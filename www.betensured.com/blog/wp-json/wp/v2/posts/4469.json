Well, the result was commensurate with the performance. Manchester United\nhad a game plan from the outset and stuck with it throughout which was mightily\nimpressive. They mostly made the right decisions whenever they played on the\ncounter attack and duly deserved their win. Manchester United is unbeaten against\nthe \u2018top teams\u2019 in the Premier League this season. They are quite devastating\non the counter and their game plan does not necessarily depend on holding on to\nthe ball for too long. The glaring issue seems to be when they play the smaller\nteams that sit back and let Manchester United do all the playing. The lack of\ncreativity in the middle and the make-up of their forwards \u2013 the likes of\nRashford, James and Martial seem to like running into spaces in the final\nthird- seems to put them at a disadvantage when they do not play against teams\nlike Manchester City. That would need to be looked into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Manchester City, the middle was always overrun with\nalmost every Manchester United counter-attack. They missed the midfield muscle\nof Fernandinho. Oh, he was playing alright, but was playing in the wrong\nposition. Rodri has so far shown that he can move the ball well but was\npractically non-existent whenever Manchester United charged forward. Is the\ntitle race over for the blue side of Manchester? Not mathematically it isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Old Lady finally falls..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that Juventus has not set the Serie A and the\nChampions League alight. They have struggled in practically all their games.\nMany thought that Juventus would go back on top after Inter Milan\u2019s draw with\nRoma. Against Lazio at the Stadio Olympico, their run came to an end. You would\nnot have bet against them coming away with something had Juan Cuardado not been\nsent off. Their best player was Wojciech Szczseny, who made some spectacular\nsaves, especially the penalty and the rebound. Ultimately, there is only so\nmuch that you can do when your team goes a man down and is poor defensively on\nthe night. Fortunately, all is not lost for Juventus and Maurizio Sarri as they\nare only two points behind Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter Milan. Do not blink just yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Bayern Munich loses again\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bayern Munich lost for the second consecutive weekend to\ntable topping Borussia Mochengladbach and are down to seventh place in the\nBundesliga. If you saw this game, the Bayern players were so wasteful in front\nof goal \u2013 yes, Mr. Lewandowski, I am looking at you \u2013 and were eventually\npunish via a last minute penalty. Luckily for Bayern Munich, the lead is not\ninsurmountable \u2013 only seven points- but one is beginning to get the feeling\nthat once Lewandowski does not find the back of the net, not many other people\ncan. That is a game plan that may need to be looked at as the bad spell has\ncoincided with his own dry spell. Another loss and it would be extremely\ndifficult to recover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>El Clasico finely poised..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real Madrid and Barcelona are joint top of the La Liga table\nwith 34 points this season. Both teams have not really been at their best this\nseason. Both teams have had some shocking results this season. Unfortunately,\nno other team has been able to take advantage of their frailties \u2013 side eye to\nDiego Simeone and Atletico Madrid. If this trend continues, the first El\nClasico of the season slated for the 18<sup>th<\/sup> of December would have an\nimpact on La Liga proceedings- bar any postponement.
