Not Bayern Munich. They started like they had a score to settle, scoring eight in the process. With Leroy Sane added to their ranks, Bayern Munich, the team that just won the treble as recently as last month is even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Manchester United not yet up and running..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately for Manchester United and their fans, there were no fans in the stadium to witness a very drab display. There was some questionable officiating but ultimately, Manchester United did not deserve to win the game. On the bright side, Donny Van de Beek scored on his debut and there would be hope that his form continues. It is understandable that fans are urging the owners to sign new players as all their rivals have improved their squads but that was far from the reason why they put up a very flat performance in the opening game of the season at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Crystal Palace, this is a very bright start. For a team that does not score a lot of goals, scoring three at Old Trafford would be a very welcome improvement. The need to hold on to Wilfred Zaha could not be more obvious. The question is: how long can they do so?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Liverpool win comfortably..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Stamford Bridge, Liverpool put two goals with no reply past Chelsea and this was helped by the fact that Andreas Christensen and Kepa Arizzabalaga had horrible outings. Liverpool\u2019s signing of Thiago is definitely a masterstroke and he had a very controlled performance in the second half. Chelsea, with a man down had the chance to put on the pressure when they had a penalty kick but Jorginho missed. Frank Lampard will definitely want more from this relatively new team especially as he has made a high number of signings. There will be fewer excuses for him this time around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Liverpool and Klopp, this has been a relatively quiet transfer window as it seems that the key area of improvement has been taken care of. Winning away to one of your closest rivals is always a good feeling. Next up: Arsenal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Juventus start off comfortably..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With flamboyant Andre Pirlo as Juventus Manager, fans and neutrals generally do not know what to expect just yet. Against Sampdoria, he gave us a faint idea as Juventus comfortably won by three goals and Dejan Kulusevski already looks like a very fine capture. This is shaping up to be a memorable Serie A season as the likes of AC Milan and Inter Milan really look good for their money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Real Madrid held at the San Mames..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spanish Champions could not do much as they were held by a very resolute Real Sociedad side. It looked to see Martin Odegaard back for the Los Blancos and ultimately, his presence was not enough to secure all three points against his former side. Karim Benzema is the only remaining player of the famous BBC trident and he would have his work cut out for him on the sharp end of things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unstoppable Bayern Munich..
