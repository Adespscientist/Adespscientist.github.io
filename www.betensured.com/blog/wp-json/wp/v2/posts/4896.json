Whether you\u2019re playing live\npoker, tournaments or even in poker rooms, you should strive to be the better\nopponent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are poker strategies to help you\nbe the best gambler you could ever be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Aggressively Play Fewer Hands&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There is really no limit on the number\nof hands you can play. However, you should strive to play fewer hands. When\nyou\u2019re playing too many hands, you\u2019ll end up bleeding away your chip\nstack.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of playing many hands, focus on\ndeveloping a solid pre-flop poker strategy. Understand that strategy\ndevelopment is the easy part because many gamblers have a hard time sticking to\ntheir plan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can, download reliable pre-flop\ncharts and ensure you play patiently. Head over to <a href=\"https:\/\/beastsofpoker.com\">BeastOfPoker<\/a> to find the best poker deals and poker\nsites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impatience can mess up even the world\u2019s\nbest players because you\u2019ll end up playing a hand that\u2019s not worth playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on playing a tight range of\nstrong hands and do this aggressively. This approach allows you to disguise the\nstrengths of your individual hands. Whether you\u2019re playing a playable hand, or\nmore speculative ones, your opponent won\u2019t know the difference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes you a very strong opponent\nbecause your wins will take other gamblers by surprise. Playing a tight and\naggressive poker game is the best way to secure the bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Don\u2019t be the First to Limp<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to win, you should never be\nthe first player to limp. This is an absolute no-no because you\u2019re unlikely to\nwin the pot prior to the flop like you could if you raised.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re the first to limp, you\u2019re\ngiving other players behind you, enticing odds. This means that you\u2019ll be at a\ndisadvantage and on top of this, you\u2019ll end up facing multiple players.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ideal time to limb is when another\nplayer has already limped. Over-limping is a good play because you get great\npot odds which allows you to hit another play on the flop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Semi-Bluff Aggressively with your Draws<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret to crushing poker is\nlearning how to bluff effectively. This is a tricky play because when you bluff\nineffectively, you can easily lose everything.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you ensure the opponents believe\nyou when you bluff?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to keep your bluffing\nfrequency under control because if you\u2019re always bluffing, opponents see it\ncoming.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective way to do this is to\nlet your cards dictate if it\u2019s an ideal time to bluff or not. This means you\nshould only bluff when the outcome improves your best hand on a later\nstreet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you have flush draws,\nstraight draws, or even an over-card, you have a backup plan in case your bluff\ngets called.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are called semi-bluffs because\neven when your bluff gets called, there\u2019s still potential beyond the bluff\nitself. When you\u2019re just starting out as a poker player, avoid bluffing until\nyou get the hung of the game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fast-Play your Strong Hands to Build the Pot&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have strong hands, don\u2019t be\nafraid to play them fast and chase your opponent out of the pot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you bet your strong hands, you\nbuild your pot and ultimately win more money. Fast playing strong hands also\nprotect your equity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, you should not always raise\nyour strong hands post-flop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are instances where it\u2019s okay to\ncheck your strong hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When it\u2019s unlikely\n     that you\u2019ll be outdrawn&nbsp;<\/li><li>When there are\n     few scare cards stopping you from getting money on later streets<\/li><li>When your opponent has more hands that don\u2019t\n     have showdown value<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when you\u2019re uncertain of the\nstakes, just check-raise; especially if you were not the pre-flop\naggressor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fold When you\u2019re Unsure<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between a bad poker\nplayer and a professional is knowing when you\u2019re beaten. Before you start\nplaying poker, you should understand that you will not always win. You\u2019re bound\nto meet better players online every once in a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound simple to do, but even\nthe best poker players find it very hard to fold. Everyone naturally wants to\nwin, and folding is surrendering your chance of winning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each time you\u2019re unsure whether you\nshould call or fold, the best move is to fold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poker is an intriguing game because\nit\u2019s always testing your limits. You need easy to learn tricks that help you\nthink fast on your feet. Ensure you train yourself to be a patient player\nbecause playing fast can easily cost you a win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poker Strategies you need to know about Every gambler needs easy to remember poker tips to ensure they have a competitive advantage over their opponents.&nbsp; When you know the right moves to make, you\u2019ll gamble with confidence and increase your affinity for winning.&nbsp; To be a profitable poker player, you should use each opportunity to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
