On Saturday, the woeful form continued as\nLeicester City produced a very good comeback to steal all three points. For\nTottenham, if they want to get back on track, the abysmal away form would need\nto be addressed. As for Leicester City, save for the loss last weekend to\nManchester United, they seem to be on the right track under Brendan Rodgers. If\nthey continue in this manner, they would most likely be the ones to take Spur\u2019s\nplace in the top four.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Liverpool see off stubborn Chelsea..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool had to fight hard to keep their\n100% record in check yesterday against a youthful and resilient Chelsea.\nObviously, two beautifully executed set-pieces were enough to down the Blues at\nthe Bridge. However, the game could have taken a positive turn had Tammy Abraham\ntaken his chance or if Azpilicueta\u2019s chance was not ruled out. Fine margins.\nUltimately, it was the lack of experience that was ultimately their undoing, in\nfront and at the back. It is back to the drawing board for Frank Lampard. For\nKlopp and Liverpool, they are the team to beat now and it is going to be a\nmassive ask for any team to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>One-sided Milan Derby..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter Milan side produced\nan impressive performance by defeating their arch-rivals (not Juventus) in very\nimpressive fashion. They could have had more but a 2-0 win is always satisfying\nand gives you bragging rights until the next one. Antonio Conte seems to be the\nreal deal. Can he topple the Juventus juggernaut, can his team remain strong\nfor the 38-game marathon, bearing in mind that Napoli has tried and failed\n(twice) in the last couple of years? Time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Barcelona gets wake-up call..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Barcelona has not scored a goal in 180 minutes\nnow. Is it yet time for a crisis talk? In the last one week, they have looked\nvery disjointed without Lionel Messi. Against Granada, nothing seemed to work.\nThey barely tested Rui Silva and it is hard to imagine that a lot of millions\nhave been spent in recent years (I am looking at you Dembele, Coutinho and\nGriezmnann) in key areas and there is practically nothing to show for that.\nBarcelona is just four points behind the top of the league but would need to\nget things sorted out as quickly as possible to be back in contention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Neymar still key to Paris St. Germain..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neymar scored the only goal \u2013 a very good\none- against one of their toughest opponents in Ligue 1 to keep them at the\ntop. You might as well been reading a post from last week about Neymar and PSG\nbecause this is exactly what happened last week. PSG seems to be in very fine\nform as they have not conceded a goal since the 18<sup>th<\/sup> of August.\nImpressive. Regardless of the goings-on surrounding certain players, PSG would\nmost definitely need a fit Neymar if they want to make strides towards lifting\nthe trophy with the big ears.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tottenham away blues continues..
