Its popularity also translates to land-based casinos, with\nblackjack tables a plentiful and regular feature of casinos across the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While blackjack has a\nsimple premise with easy-to-learn rules, there are plenty of variables and\nelements to consider when playing. With that in mind, here is the complete\nguide to blackjack, including the rules and processes and a few key strategies,\ndos and don\u2019ts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Blackjack\nbasics<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic rules of\nblackjack are quite straightforward. Playing against the house, your aim is to\nreach the value of 21, or as close to 21 as possible, through the cards dealt\nto you by the dealer. The house will also be aiming to reach 21 and whoever is\ncloser wins the hand, although the value of your hand cannot go over the value\nof 21. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game starts by the\ndealer dealing you two cards and themselves one card. Based on the value of your\ntwo cards, you then decide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kjartan.co.uk\/games\/blackjack.htm\">\u2018hit\u2019, \u2018stand\u2019 or \u2018split\u2019<\/a>. If you decide to hit, the dealer will deal\nyou another card. If you choose to stand, then the value of your two cards is\nfinal. You have the option to split when dealt two cards of the same value.\nThis will then create a new hand and the dealer will deal two more cards \u2013 one\nfor each hand. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have settled\non the final value of your hand, the dealer will then deal themselves another\ncard. If the dealers\u2019 two cards provide a value of 17 or more, they have to\nstick. If it is less than 17, they will continue to deal cards to themselves\nuntil the value exceeds 17. The round is decided either by who has the higher\nvalue hand or who went bust by going over the value of 21. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best hand to get\nis Ace and a 10-value card (10, jack, queen, king), which is called \u2018blackjack\u2019\nand not only ensures winning the hand but typically comes with a bonus, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Basic\nblackjack strategies<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other popular\ncasino games like roulette and slots, blackjack affords players a degree of\ncontrol. How players use that control can make the difference between success\nand failure. In a typical game of blackjack, the house holds an edge between\none and two percent. By using the below basic strategies of <a href=\"https:\/\/extra.betamerica.com\/casino\/blackjack\/how-to-play\/\">how to play blackjack<\/a> on BetAmerica.com, you can reduce the house edge to around 0.5\npercent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to stand:<\/strong> Always stand when your two cards provide a\nvalue of between 12 and 16 and the dealer\u2019s card is between 2 and 6.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to hit:<\/strong> Always hit when your hand is valued between 12\nand 16 and the dealer holds an Ace and a 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to split:<\/strong> Always split when you have either two Aces or\ntwo 8s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to double:<\/strong> Always double when your two cards offer a\nvalue of 11 and the dealer\u2019s card is between 2 and 10. In other words, double\nwhen you have 11 and the dealer is holding any card other than an Ace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Important\nblackjack advice<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic strategies\nabove will hold you in good stead when playing blackjack, but there are other\nimportant considerations to not only maximise your chances of success but limit\nyour losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Don\u2019t\ncompare yourself to others<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This only applies to\ngames played in live online casinos or in land-based casinos when you are sat\nnext to another player, but it is vital nonetheless: Always remember that you\nare only playing against the house, not any other players sat at the same\ntable, so don\u2019t let others\u2019 actions influence your own decisions. Casino tables\nare always full of so-called \u2018experts\u2019 \u2013 so just focus on your own hands and\ntry not to compare your actions to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Don\u2019t\nbuy insurance<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance is offered\nwhen the dealer deals themselves an Ace. It is, therefore, a special side bet\nthat allows players to stake half of the value of their original bet against\nthe possibility of the dealer landing blackjack. If the dealer lands blackjack,\nyou win the insurance bet, but if the dealer doesn\u2019t have blackjack, you lose\nthe insurance bet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the insurance\nbet can be tempting, all casino experts agree that it is not worth taking. If\nthe dealer hits blackjack, it will only push the bet, so you break even. It is\ntherefore a no-win no-lose situation and not worth the risk. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Base\ndecisions on dealer\u2019s up card<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more important\nthan the two cards you hold is the value of the dealer\u2019s up card. Before making\nany decision over whether to hit, stick, or split, first consider what the\ndealer holds. If the dealer\u2019s card is between 2 and 6 or if it\u2019s between 7 and\nAce will determine your action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Manage\nyour finances<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All seasoned casino\nplayers, whichever game they play, will agree that how you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dummies.com\/games\/casino-games\/how-to-manage-your-money-at-a-gambling-casino\/\">manage your finances is fundamental<\/a>. Before you begin a game of blackjack, set\nyourself concrete limits. This works both ways: set a limit on how much you can\nafford to lose and stick to it. There is nothing more damaging than emotional\nbetting while trying to claw back losses \u2013 it is a guaranteed recipe for\ndisaster. Likewise, set a limit on your winnings: eventually, your luck will\nturn, so if you win a certain amount, have the discipline to walk away and\ncount your profits. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Complete Beginner\u2019s Guide on How to Play Blackjack Blackjack is the most popular casino game in the world, accounting for around than one-third of all table players on online casino platforms.
