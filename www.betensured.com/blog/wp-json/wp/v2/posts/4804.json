It is a very detailed explanation for serious bettors who wish to make money with a type of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/matched-betting-a-beginners-guide\/\">matched betting<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Lay Betting?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay betting can simply be said to be an option where a gambler stakes on an event not to come to pass. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This option allows you to take the position of a bookie, where you play the opposite of an event. A good example is if you think Manchester City with its array of lethal attacks cannot win the English Premiership league, even when you are not sure who will win it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you do then, is to simply bet that Manchester City will not win. As long as Manchester City doesn&#8217;t win the league after 38 league games, you win the stake. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay betting is an aspect of matched betting or arb betting that is gradually dominating the betting scene. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay betting is the opposite of back betting. While lay bettors bet on an event not to happen, a back bettor bets on the opposite; they bet that an event a lay bettor bets on will happen. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of betting happens on the Exchange market, and it is not common among bookmakers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to find a back bettor to be able to stake your bet. Both the lay bettor and back bettor will have to agree on the odds before this bet can be finalized. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookmakers provide a platform for the trade and in turn, get a commission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is Lay Betting Profitable?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay betting is a profitable endeavor if you are prudent and patient. The best avenue to make a profit in lay betting is by combining lay bets and back bets. Also, note that there are several free bet offers and refunds made possible at the exchange market due to lay betting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get profits from lay betting, you will need to join and know how to use a profit accumulator. This profit accumulator helps you source for all daily offers meant for bettors. It will also show you steps (which include slide and video presentations) on how to make a profit from daily lay betting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from profit accumulation, you will need to take these steps to make money from lay betting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Get a good bookie<\/strong>: Not all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bettingsites24.ng\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"top bookmakers (opens in a new tab)\">top bookmakers<\/a> offer the option of lay betting. You will need to check the ones that offer it and the ones best suited for you. Also, some bookmakers offer very low commission for both the back bettors and lay bettors. Check online for such reasonable bookies. There are a few who also give lots of offers and free bets on exchange and matched betting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Avoid multiple lay bets:<\/strong> To make enough profit on lay betting, you need to avoid staking on multiple lay bets and concentrate only on single bets. In as much as it is tempting to &#8221; spread your nets&#8221;, avoid being greedy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Always do background checks<\/strong>: Carry out enough research (statistics and form) before placing a lay bet. These minor details go a long way in increasing the possibilities of your events not coming to pass. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Avoid fixed lay bets<\/strong>: Be careful with people touting to have fixed games both online and offline, 99% of supposed fixed games are frauds. These fraudsters have swindled lots of amateurs in lay betting with their claims. So stick to what you know. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Start small<\/strong>: As a newbie in lay betting, always start with small amounts. You will learn more and be confident as you progress in lay betting. Learn while taking minimal risks first before taking larger risks when you have learned more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/football-betting-guide\/\">beginner&#8217;s guide to football betting<\/a> here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Liability In Lay Betting?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In lay betting, liability is the amount of stake you\ncan lose, if everything goes south with your bet. Most punters prefer to lay a\nbet at add-ons so that their liability will be mitigated. A typical example is,\nwhen you lay a bet at 2.50 odds for 20 dollars, you are liable for 30 dollars\nand could win 20 dollars if the stake comes through. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be in your interest to check how much your\nliability will be and how much profit you will make eventually. Make sure your\ndecimal is apparent (e.g 2.50) and not 250 or else you will suffer a financial suicide.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How\nDo You Place A Lay Bet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To place a lay bet, you need a Betting Exchange. To get\na Betting Exchange, you will need gamblers alike who are willing to back the\nodds you wish to lay. This means that, if there is no available back bettor,\nyou can&#8217;t lay a bet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scenario implies that you need an amount of\ncash available at the Exchange market to lay a bet. To put this simply; when\nthere is no one to bet with you, you can&#8217;t stake a lay bet alone. Also, keep\nyour eyes open, as odds on bet change swiftly and it could be unavailable at any\ntime. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Processes Of Placing A Lay Bet:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Find a reputable Betting Exchange <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Get a bet at good odds<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Find a back bettor<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Agree on liability and stake<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Lay a bet<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bookmakers With Lay Bet Options <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several bookmakers allow this type of betting option.\nHowever, the four most reliable ones are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/smarkets.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Smarkets (opens in a new tab)\">Smarkets<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exchange market lets you lay and back bets on\nall important sports.

That is why it is important to read the terms\nand conditions attached to all transactions. Looking at lay bets which is\nbetween two individuals, we would think that there shouldn&#8217;t be a cap on the\namount to win, but it is more technical than that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of these betting exchanges do not have a\nstipulated amount that can be won, there is however a cap on daily maximum\npayouts. These maximum payouts can sometimes depend on the particular sport you\nare staking on, as the case is with Betfair. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Betfair<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sports: Football \u2013 \u00a31million <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse racing \u2013 \u00a31 million <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTennis \u2013 \u00a3500,000<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSnooker \u2013 \u00a3100,000<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDarts \u2013 \u00a3250,000<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with other bookmakers\/ betting exchange, it\nis not as strict as the above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smarkets<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimum payout \u2013 \u00a30.05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximum payout \u2013 \u00a399,999<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Betdaq<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimum payout \u2013 \u00a30.01<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximum payout \u2013 \u00a3250,000<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lay\nBet Example <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can lay a bet on any sports of your choice as\nlong as it is available at the betting exchange. A vivid example of lay betting\nin football and basketball will be portrayed below;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example\nOf Lay Betting In Basketball<\/strong>;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami\nHits have a game and you want to lay a bet on any of the team, you can lay a\nbet on, let\u2019s say, the Los Angeles Lakers. By so doing, you are saying the\nLakers will not win the game. This means as long as the other team wins the\ngame, your bet is secured. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Example\nOf A Lay Bet In Football<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the beginning of La Liga Santanda. With 20\nteams, you go to the exchange and look to lay bet against Barcelona not to win\nthe league. This is a very risky bet, but you are willing to bet with anybody\nthat this year league will be won by other teams and not Barcelona. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why\nDo People Prefer Lay Bets Over Other Options? <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Some bettors find it easier to pick an event that\nwon&#8217;t happen over the possibility. Some gamblers just like odd games. They like\nstaking against the favourites. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Bettors lay bet because they think the odds are\nlow, even when the probability is high. Some gamblers basically deal with odds.\nIf they think they see a good odd for an event, they will just stake on it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Some bettors engage in what we call trading. They\nbelieve their funds are safe if they lay a bet on an event and go back during\nthe match to back such event. Lay betting affords such bettors to engage in\nsuch trade. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Most people that engage in lay bet do so because\nit seems safer than any type of gambling. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>&nbsp;Lay Bet Calculator <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be in your best interest to know how lay\nbets are calculated. This will let you know your profits and liability. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay Stake: $10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay commission: 2%<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay odds: 1.50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liability: $5.00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Return: $10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commission paid: $0.20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profit after commission paid: $9. 80<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you lay a bet at $10 with the odds at 1.50, the\nbetting exchange collects a commission of 2% on the exchange. Your liability\nwill be half of your stake while return (profit) should be $10. However, the bookmaker,\nwhere the exchange takes place, charges a commission of 2%, making your total\nprofit (if you win) $9.80.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay bet is a kind of match betting which is done at the betting exchanges. It is not like your regular kind of betting where you bet on fixed-odds by the bookmaker. With lay bet, you (the lay bettor) and your opponent (back bettor) agree to stake on an event that may or may not come to make a profit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The role of the bookmaker here is to serve as a\nplatform and they collect a commission on the winning. This commission\npercentage depends on the bookie that you use. The amount that you can make\nfrom lay bet depends on how much you stake with and the maximum amount your\nbookie allows you to withdraw. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have mentioned some bookies that allow this type\nof betting exchange and the benefits they offer. If you do not know how to\ncalculate your liability and profit with lay bet, the sample calculator\nprovided above will help you in calculating with lay bet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lay bet can be safe and profitable if you follow the tips and guidelines given in this article keenly. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What comes to mind when you hear lay betting?
