Then read this football betting guide we carefully put together. Betting, especially<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sports_betting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> football betting<\/a>, has come a long way and it has come to stay. Now people don\u2019t just go to games to watch their favorite team win, but many people watch football matches to make some money by using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betensured.com\">football predictions sites<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But how can this be achieved?<\/p>\n<p>All things being equal. It is simply by placing your bet on a team to win or lose. Even fans now place bets against their favorite team all just to make a profit. So apart from reading their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/top-100-soccer-blogs\/\">favorite sports blogs<\/a> or watching their favorite sport, they now have a chance to make some money as well, all things being equal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Bet On Football Online<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Football betting has grown immensely in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century. Individuals have made quite a lot of money from betting on their favorite football teams online. Although you can bet both online and offline, we are mainly concerned with how to bet on football online.<\/p>\n<p>To start with, you need to understand the dynamics of betting in general, you either lose or win, therefore you need money to be able to win. You also need to decide whether you will be a punter or a gambler.<\/p>\n<p>A punter will put huge loads of money on relatively low-risk odds, while a gamble will put little money at huge odds. This can be explained like this a punter will decide to put 2,000 Euros on a single game of 2 odds and win 4,000 Euros, while a gamble will bet with 50 Euros on large amounts of games worth 100 odds to win 5,000 Euros.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is that the punter minimizes its risk while a gamble will bet on luck if you ask me if you have money choose to be a punter.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you will need to decide which betting sites and bookmakers you will like to use, there are a plethora of bookmakers online that are ready to do business with you, therefore choose the one that is more reliable.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, decide on the leagues that you will like to bet on, the most popular leagues are the premiership, Spanish La Liga and the Italian Serie&nbsp; A. they are reliable and have limited games that are fixed. Most bookmakers allow you to use your credit card to fund your online account<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Football betting odds explained<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Football odds are statistical algorithms which bookmakers design to help bettors determine the games they are going to pick, In football betting, there are strong and weak teams,<\/p>\n<p>The strong teams get relatively low odds especially when they are playing at their home ground while the weak teams get high odds especially when they are away from home. However if two weak teams are playing against each other, their betting odds will be almost the same team. Let us say Burnley is playing against Bournemouth you will have this type of odds<\/p>\n<p>Burnley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bournemouth<\/p>\n<p>2.55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.56<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, do not be fooled by these odds, because either low or high odds do not really matter if certain factors come to play.<\/p>\n<p>Such factors are injuries, the form of the team, suspensions and red cards.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore a weak team with a huge odds of say 16 odds can defeat a strong team with 1,10 odds if they are off form, This scenario happened this season when Burnley defeated Chelsea at home and also when Bournemouth defeated Chelsea at home. On that day the weaker side won and the bookmakers smile to the banks.<\/p>\n<p>Be wise, when choosing odds book early to get good odds and also look at the other factors that contribute to the outcomes of games. The odds used in this explanation are mainly UK odds, US odds are infractions .e.g 2\/3,11\/10..e.t.c<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Football Value Bets&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you think you can make easy money in gambling, my dear you better take heed, bookmakers are making sure you don\u2019t win, therefore you have to work extra hard to make money on a football bet.<\/p>\n<p>All we do in life should be done only when a certain value is attached to it, therefore betting on football should be able taking advantage of the value we attach to it.<\/p>\n<p>The only way to make money from betting on football is attaching a value to it and making serious interest from it. A value bet occurs when we believe that the chances of a particular outcome are higher than what the odds suggest. What this implies is that only bet when there is a high probability that you will win.<\/p>\n<p>Look at this scenario<\/p>\n<p>An Example: Arsenal vs Wigan<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Value football betting is where your knowledge of football comes into play. Let&#8217;s consider two Premier League clubs in this example, the gunners at home to Wigan. Bookmakers are offering the following odds for the match result market:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Arsenal&nbsp; 1.25<\/p>\n<p>Draw 4.80<\/p>\n<p>Wigan&nbsp; 7.90<\/p>\n<p>For those that are keen followers of the English Premiership, we deduce that Arsenal is a top team but they always fail to perform when they face a relatively low team, also Wigan may be underdogs, but they need this win to avoid relegation at all cost.<\/p>\n<p>With all this information at heart, we believe that Wigan has a good chance of winning this game, making the odds of 7.90 well worth a bet.<\/p>\n<p>These odds imply that Wigan is an 18.7% chance to win. We believe their chances, while still slim, is very close to 20%. This is what value bet is all about; this is because even when the odds are against an underdog, other factors suggest that the team can perform when needed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong> How to bet on football and win<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is always a good thing to bet on football and win,but let us be frank with ourselves it is impossible to always win every time, so if anybody wants to sell a book or tells you he or she has a fool-proof to win on football always ,is simply not saying the truth or simply wants to rip you off, in betting, you win some and lose somewhat you should make sure is that you win more than you lose.<\/p>\n<p>Most blogs and betting sites that claim to have all the answers are just using basic marketing strategies to hook you, you have to discover yourself what will make you win more and lose.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While it is not possible to win football bets all the time, there are certain things you need to know if you wish to win at all when it comes to football, there are basic principles:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place Bet Only When There Is Value for your money<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be prepared To learn from experts<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bet only on The Leagues you are familiar with<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bet on the reasonable Markets You Know<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gamble reasonable with your money, use spare cash<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you keep a Record of Your Football Bets<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploit Market loopholes<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Follow Football Betting Tips and hint that look promising<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp; &nbsp;Register online Accounts with Multiple Bookmakers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free Football Betting Database<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Free football betting database comprises of statistical charts of leagues and clubs and how they compare with each other.<\/p>\n<p>This option can be found in online bookmakers who make it available for bettors who wish to view what each teams winning and losing history looks like.<\/p>\n<p>This option will allow you to compare two teams basically and how they have fared with each other over the seasons.<\/p>\n<p>It compares the number of wins, draws, and losses.

This is because there are different ways of making money on a football bet, therefore what works for tom may not work for a job?<\/p>\n<p>What did we advise though is to research carefully and create a niche you desire?<\/p>\n<p>What should be noted however is that there are many bets to be explored which will be profitable in this betting business, depending on several factors which range from experience, amount of capital and the fear factor, there are various betting option to explore, they are but not limited to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Straight win option<\/li>\n<li>Over and under 1.5-4.5<\/li>\n<li>Handicap<\/li>\n<li>Straight Draws<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>5 Double Mix options<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Draw no bet (DNB)<\/li>\n<li>BTS (GG) and NG<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>8 10- 15 minutes Draw<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Straight win<\/strong>: This option is marked 1&#215;2, and it entails that one of the two teams will likely win, therefore, if you feel the home team will win just click on 1, if you feel the away team will win just click on 2.It is a very risky option however it comes with huge odds and bonuses<\/p>\n<p><strong>Over and undder1.5-4.5<\/strong>: This options deals with goals, it means over and under 2 goals, 3goals, and 4 goals.

Let&#8217;s say for example an Arsenal team is playing against Liverpool. Both teams are a high scoring team and have a very shaky defense.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong> &nbsp; How to Place Football Bets Online<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Placing foot bets online is very easy once you are familiar with betting in general, however, you need to know the exact bookmaker to use when placing a bet to boost your chances of winning.<\/p>\n<p>The question to ask this is which online bookie is best for you?<\/p>\n<p>Choosing the right bookie is more than just asking, you need to do and in-depth research on the reliable bookies around and what they can offer you.
