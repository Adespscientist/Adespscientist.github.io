Patrice Evra is 36, he has got two children. He has played five Champions League finals, a Euro final, won lots of titles and this is probably the last few weeks of his career &#8211; it is really sad this is how he is going to end.<\/p>\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t abuse your own player &#8211; the abuse from the fans was targeted only at Evra &#8211; but Evra should never have responded the way he did.<\/p>\n<p>It has been really tough for him since the beginning of the season. He lost his place in the team, he has been really poor every time he played, and I think he just couldn&#8217;t take the jeers, the abuse.<\/p>\n<p>There were a lot of insults, but the fans were also saying stuff like: &#8220;You&#8217;re rubbish, go home. Keep doing your videos, but stop playing football.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The way they insulted him and his family &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t justify his reaction &#8211; but you can see why he got frustrated.<\/p>\n<p>He is 100%. He says things like they are, he reacts the way they are. He says there are no fibs with him, so you get it as he says it or as he does it. Sometimes he should think a bit more.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \"><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \"><img data-attachment-id=\"3445\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/marseille-suspend-patrice-evra-after-kicking-fan-during-warm-up\/_98596109_capture\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?fit=624%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"624,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"_98596109_capture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?fit=267%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?fit=624%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3445\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?resize=624%2C700\" alt=\"_98596109_capture\" width=\"624\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?resize=267%2C300&amp;ssl=1 267w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98596109_capture.jpg?resize=374%2C420&amp;ssl=1 374w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figcaption><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">This is how French newspaper L&#8217;Equipe reported the incident<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<footer id=\"story-footer\" class=\"story-footer\">\n<div class=\"clearfix gel-mb+\"><\/div>\n<\/footer>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Marseille have suspended Patrice Evra after he kicked a fan in the head before his side&#8217;s Europa League defeat at Vitoria Guimaraes on Thursday.
