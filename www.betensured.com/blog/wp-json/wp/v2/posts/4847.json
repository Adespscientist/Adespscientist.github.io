The English club were accused\nof breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, yet after a successful\nappeals process, they were able to overturn that decision via the Court of\nArbitration for Sport (CAS).

Five will be\ncompeting for the two remaining Champions League spots, while the rest will be\nbattling for up to three Europa League spots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so\nmuch at stake during the final games of the campaign, shopping around for the\nbest Premier League match odds will certainly be worthwhile. Many of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbo.net\/football\/premier-league\/\">best Premier League betting&nbsp;sites\nwill be offering<\/a> bonus\npackages or odds boost incentives, looking to attract new customers. What\u2019s\nmore, match odds and markets can vary between betting sites, therefore checking\nreviews and making comparisons is always useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aiming to\nsecure those last two Champions League spots, jostling for third and fourth\npositions are Chelsea, Manchester United, and Leicester City. They will also be\nlooking over their shoulders, as Wolverhampton Wanderers and Sheffield United\nare also ready to pounce, should anyone above them falter. All of those teams\nlead the way as potential Europa League candidates. This is likely to lead to\nan exciting summer transfer window, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/the-most-boring-january-transfer-window-ever\/\">especially after how\nboring January&#8217;s window was<\/a>, as the new challengers look to build on their success while some of\nthe traditional heavyweights aim to get back on top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4850\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/all-to-play-for-in-the-premier-league-chase-for-europe\/attachment\/2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/2.png?fit=256%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"256,144\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/2.png?fit=256%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/2.png?fit=256%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"256\" height=\"144\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/2.png?resize=256%2C144&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4850\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image:\nPixabay<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to\nManchester City winning the League Cup earlier this season, an extra Europa\nLeague spot is now available to the Premier League. Should one of the top four\nalso win the FA Cup, the Europa League spot for that competition will also\nrevert to the Premier League. Crazy as it sounds, any of the teams currently\nbetween third and tenth, could yet claim one of the three possible Europa\nLeague spots up for grabs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\nmeans that even after having endured such difficult seasons, there may still be\na slim chance for Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, and even Burnley. Indeed, if they\nmanage to produce strong form in the final games, any of those three teams\ncould yet climb to sixth or seventh in the Premier League, earning them\nparticipation in the Europa League next season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insofar\nas most bookies are concerned, Manchester United and Chelsea are fancied to claim\nthe two Champions League spots, while Leicester City may have to settle for\nfifth position and the Europa League. They could be joined by Wolves and\nSheffield United, although odds have recently shortened for Spurs, who could\nyet make a late push.
