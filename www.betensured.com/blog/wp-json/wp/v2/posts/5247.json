The heavyweights have fought twice previously, with some fans believing there is no need for a third contest between the pair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their first bout at the end of 2018, Wilder floored Fury twice but was comprehensively outboxed for the majority of the bout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most believed the Brit had done enough to earn a decision victory, only for the judges to score it a controversial draw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fury opted to go in a different direction in 2019 and so the pair did not meet again until February 2020. This time around an aggressive \u2018Gypsy King\u2019 took the fight to the \u2018Bronze Bomber\u2019, flooring him twice and winning by stoppage in round seven. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath, Wilder activated his contractual clause to force an immediate third fight, but the pandemic interrupted those plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they approached the end of 2020, Fury\u2019s camp announced that they believed the contract had now expired and so they were moving on to target an undisputed showdown Anthony Joshua instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilder activated the dispute resolution provision within their contract, taking the matter to arbitration where a retired judge presided over the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also came out and accused Fury of\u00a0cheating\u00a0in their rematch. Just as AJ vs Fury was fully agreed for August 14 in Saudi Arabia, the arbitrator ruled that Fury owed Wilder a third fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the trilogy now official for July 24, Fury said: \u201cI\u2019m excited to once again be fighting in Las Vegas, the home of the \u2018Gypsy King.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fury is slated to fight Wilder for the third time on\u00a0Saturday, July 24.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will take place at the\u00a0T-Mobile Arena\u00a0in Las Vegas. No news on fan attendance has been made yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As this will be a pay-per-view event in Vegas, UK fans can expect it to start no earlier than\u00a04am on Sunday morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles will be on the line and the winner could then take on Anthony Joshua in a huge unification bout later in the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor the last 18 months, I\u2019ve been living rent free in Wilder\u2019s head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe got smashed to pieces in our last fight, and for some reason, he wants it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. The big dosser is getting knocked spark out.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilder said: \u201cNothing has changed. It\u2019s still one face, one name, one champion \u2013 Deontay Wilder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the best shape of my life. July 24, I\u2019m going to show the people why I\u2019m still the baddest man on the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fury vs Wilder 3: What has been said?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson Fury: \u201cYou\u2019re getting smashed.

Even right now, I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy mentality is \u2013 you\u2019ve been contemplating about hurting a person so bad, to the point you wanna disfigure him so his mother wouldn\u2019t even know who he was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had your mind on that, like you wanna decapitate him in every f****** way possible, it\u2019s like that premeditated stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I do see him, I\u2019m gonna love to see what I feel and what I\u2019m thinking, how my senses change when he\u2019s in my environment. I\u2019ve been contemplating, premeditating whooping this man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow that we have a date, like training has been even more intense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose other camps, although they were intense, we had no guidance, no ETA, we just knew we wanted to stay in shape\u2026 Now it means something now. It\u2019s for certain now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you got to go through me.
