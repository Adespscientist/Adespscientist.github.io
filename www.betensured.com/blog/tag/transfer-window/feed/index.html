<ul><li>Where Are My Signings?!</li></ul>



<p>This has been a very disappointing January transfer window as clubs refuse to spend big and address weaknesses. If you’re not a Liverpool fan, you should be worried about your club’s future. With 2 days left till deadline day, it is likely that we&#8217;ll be watching the same players for the next 4 months. Here are the recent updates in transfers.</p>



<h2>England&#8217;s Top 6</h2>

<p>Champions-elect Liverpool don’t need any signings, yet they snapped up energetic Minamino for only £7m. If rumours of their interest in Mbappe are true, I personally believe the move should be ruled illegal. Just imagine the mayhem Mane, Salah, and Mbappe will cause- with Firmino playing No. 10! Game Over. </p>



<p>As for Man City, Guardiola has confirmed there will be no new signings, and why should there? Look at that star-studded squad, with Leroy Sane back from injury. Meanwhile, 3<sup>rd</sup> place Leicester City need a backup for injured Ndidi, and extra spice- maybe a world-class winger- to be taken seriously. However, there are no plans this January. </p>



<h2>Where are my signings?!</h2>

[REX FEARTURES]</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some clubs don’t take UCL qualification seriously! They form the 3 big losers this January Transfer window- Chelsea, Man Utd, and Tottenham.</p>



<p>Chelsea look just as confused as their manager Frank Lampard- targeting Werner, Sancho, Dembele &amp; Zaha to no fruition. They have the EPL’s worst-keeper Kepa, and an unsettled defence, but have no plans to fix it. This is a team that was given a major boost in December as the transfer ban was lifted, and have a £150m transfer war chest. They are yet to sign a player with 2 days left. This club is a joke!</p>



<p>Man Utd. Glazers. Ed Woodword. It’s looking like another disaster January transfer window for the Red Devils who had their eyes on Bruno Fernandes. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="‘So Bruno Fernandes come to United or no?’ (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10801673/mourinho-jokes-bruno-fernandes-saga/" target="_blank">‘So Bruno Fernandes come to United or no?’</a> Asks a jocular Mourinho. Who wouldn’t find this United side funny? They missed out on Norwegian wonderkid Haaland and now plan to recall Alexis Sanchez! The real tragedy is that Paul Pogba remains in this unhappy marriage.</p>



<p>Tottenham’s only signing is Gedson Fernandes (on loan), a useless one to say the least. With Harry Kane injured and Eriksen joining Inter, Spurs look seriously depleted, and it is unlikely they will loan Gareth Bale. &nbsp;Whereas, rivals Arsenal look set to sign Flamengo star defender Pablo Mari on loan-to-buy, to tighten up the defence.</p>



<h2>Best of the Rest </h2>



<p>A hot rumour is going around that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman is engineering a takeover of Newcastle United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://talksport.com/football/661565/newcastle-takeover-saudi-arabia-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-talksport-source/" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman is engineering a takeover of Newcastle United</a>. While Aston Villa continue spending, introducing washed-up Pepe Reina, and Danny Drinkwater, and securing the exciting Tanzanian forward Samatta. </p>



<h2>Rest of Europe </h2>

<p>Conte’s Inter Milan now look ready to take on Juventus. They are the biggest winners this January transfer window, increasing the squad depth by securing Victor Moses, Ashley Young, and the world-class Christian Eriksen for £17m. No doubt Eriksen&#8217;s stock price on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Football Index (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.footballindex.co.uk/" target="_blank">Football Index</a> will rise, and investors will be happy with the move. Juventus are unlikely to sign anyone and are still looking to sell flop Emre Can. Meanwhile, PSG look set on losing Edison Cavani to Atletico.</p>



<p>Real Madrid continue their Brazilian invasion. Raiding the country of their best young talents, with the recent acquisition of wonderkid Reinier Jesus for £25m. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Flamengo really should have charged more for this kid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2869930-jorge-jesus-questions-flamengo-reinier-jesus-value-amid-real-madrid-rumours" target="_blank">Flamengo really should have charged more for this kid</a>. Los Blancos are building for the future, while rivals Barcelona continue to slack. Los Cules lost Suarez to a major injury, and are yet to find a replacement. </p>



<p>Finally, Dortmund stole the headlines with the signing of wonderkid Halaand for £17m, and the Norwegian wasted no time in capturing the hearts of fans, with 5-goals in 2 games. Bayern meanwhile will miss out on top target Sane this January, but are willing to wait before making any major transfer decisions. </p>
