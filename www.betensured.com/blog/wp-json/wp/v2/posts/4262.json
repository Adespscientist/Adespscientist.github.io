When bets are priced lower than what it is worth,\nthen we can categorically say it offers value. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can we say a value bet translates to?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Value is a generally used word in capital investments and this meaning is similar in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/othersports\/\">sports betting<\/a> &#8211; if a selection\u2019s probability of occurring is less than it should be, then there is an opportunity for a value bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profitable punters and\ngamblers know that there is a thin line and difference between market chances\nof happening and how the odd available can be compared. For you to be a\nsuccessful punter, you have to be able to identify and stake on these value\nbets, no matter how the probability of the outcome would happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staking on a bet that offers profitable value is not as easy as searching for odds on favorites\u2019 market. Affirmatively, odds on favorites\u2019 games are more likely to be successful than thought, but that doesn\u2019t imply such odds offer value for its bets. Instead, the way to long-term profitable betting is to understand the likelihood of an outcome of an event precisely and identifying where such market can be harmful and result in loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Connection between probability and odd<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Probability\">Probability<\/a> can be defined as the possibility of a scenario coming to pass in percentage. Betting comprises assessing the probabilities of the outcome of an event happening &#8211; from impossibilities to possibilities. Betting companies and exchange traders actually weight probability and convert it into odds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting value represents\nitself when the odds present are a pseudo-reflection of the actual probability\nof the event happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s exemplify this scenario\nwith the use of a coin toss to explain vividly what betting value is and how to\ncalculate the expected value of a bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s assume the coin and the\ntoss is fair. Each outcome (heads or tails) therefore has an equal probability\n(50%) of occurring &#8211; therefore the odds should be 2.0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of this toss will be\n0 for either a Head or Tail &#8211; so if you tossed a coin infinitely it would\ntheoretically end up all squares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say that Paul offers\nyou odds of 3.25 on Heads. We explain in detail how to calculate expected\nvalue, but for the purpose of this article the formula is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Amount won per bet x\nprobability of winning) \u2013 (Amount lost per bet x probability of losing)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you placed \u00a35 on the coin\nlanding on heads at 2.15, the expected value of the bet is calculated in the\nfollowing way: (11.50 X 0.5) \u2013 (5 X 0.5) = 3.25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shows an expected value\nof 3.25 and is great betting value. Therefore you would expect to make an\naverage profit of 3.25p for each \u00a35 bet because the odds received are better\nthan the implied odds of the coin toss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Odds with a bookmaker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you make it a habit to\nfind value bet, you will make huge money in the long run. But note that bookies\nnever intentional offer you an opportunity to place value bet, because the odds\nthey offer do not actually have the probabilities of the real outcome of\nevents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a genuine bookmaker\noffers you odds on a coin toss, it would very likely be 1.80 on both Heads and\nTails &#8211; with a margin less than 5%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you calculate the\nexpected value with the same stake but different odds would result in -0.5 &#8211;\nmeaning over time you would lose an average 80p for every \u00a310 bet and is,\ntherefore, a bad value bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if bookies odds are unfair\nand seem insurmountable, how can you as bettors ever make a profit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookmakers are gurus of\nsetting accurate odds to create a profit margin on their betting markets. But,\nsports are different from your regular casinos or coin tosses. The variables in\nsports are such that can impact the result, and this is where you as a genuine punter\ncan gain an advantage over the bookie and value bets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can I identify value bets?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking out for a good value\nbetting is not an easy task, but we will show you how you can do that and make ample\nprofits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Set your own odds according to well-researched forecast<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like when stockbrokers\nanalyse financial reports, value punters should calculate their own odds for a\nmarket using a well- researched strategy known to achieve the desired result. By\ndoing the calculating yourself, you can compare them to the bookies own on the\nbetting exchange and see if a particular selection is undervalued or\novervalued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike bookies, a betting\nexchange allows you to set your own back or lay odds irrespective of what has\nbeen offered already, which is apt for value betting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Reason along probabilities line, not favourites and underdogs (think like a bookie)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of value betting\nas we now know is to see the probability of an event more accurately than bookies\nor other bettors on an exchange. To achieve this is paramount you think in\nprobability and not just backing favourites to win, you will make a profit by\nassessing each team\u2019s chances of winning rather than just on who is stronger on\nthe pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Favourites do not always win,\nso why not, as a smart punter, key into it? Once you have calculated your own\nodds, you should aspire to pick differences in the implied probabilities for\neach event, compared to what a particular bookmaker has to offer. Don\u2019t be\nconcerned about betting on the underdog or an outcome you don&#8217;t think will be\nsuccessful if there is betting value in the odds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Assessing and evaluating<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basing your statistics on mathematics\nand probabilities is better and more feasible than basing it on emotions and\nguts feeling. Therefore, once you have analyzed your expected value you must\nassess and evaluate all other pertinent information available that can make you\nwin, such as situational factors which your model hasn\u2019t incorporated before\nmaking a decision that might affect your chances of making a profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Be a specialist<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to find value bet\nis to specialize in particular niche markets, where the playing field is fair\nbetween bookies and bettors on an exchange. When you understand a particular\nmarket very well, you will then be able to identify odds that you think can be\nof good value from your own view, providing you with an opportunity to make\nvalue bets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How you can apply this to betting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand the\ninterpretation of odds and possibilities, finding value should be easy for you\nand prominent in your betting if your desire is to make a profit in the long-run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding these\nprobabilities and calculating them precisely is the key to a successful betting\ncareer. Computing the true chances of an outcome more accurately than others\nwill provide you with potentially profitable opportunities through value\nbetting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting traders should build\ntheir own models and strategies, generating their own odds for a particular betting\nmarket. When the odds in the model differ widely enough with a compared a\nbookmaker or another bettor on an exchange, it can be assumed to be a good\nvalue bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a superior model or\ntaking advantage of information asymmetry can also be a good way to find value.\nIf a model or inside information gives the bettor a clearer grasp of true\nprobability than the bookmaker then profits are available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The importance of the long run:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When value betting, it is\nimportant to bet for the long-term. Even with the clear edge on the coin toss at\n2.2 Odds, there is still a 50% chance that the bettor loses. This is when a<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staking strategy becomes\nimportant as bankrolls can be decimated by over staking, even on bets that\noffer value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How often do professional bettors get paid?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, this\nstrategy pays off. After 100 coin flips staking &amp;10 the bettor would expect\nto have &amp;1100 from 1000 staked. In a similar way, if a sports bettor can\nfind enough value bets they will win in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know the importance of odds<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Value is all about finding\nthe best odds and no bookmaker offers better value than Pinnacle. If bettors\ntake lower odds from elsewhere then a value betting strategy becomes less\nprofitable or even loss-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some bookmakers ban winners,\nmaking a long-term value betting strategy impossible. Pinnacle operates a winner\u2019s\nwelcome policy so value bettors can make the most from their edge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, value betting is an essential skill for bettors, although not a very popular strategy, if harnessed well, it could be a gold mine for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/football-betting-guide\/\">diligent punter<\/a>. One should also not forget that value bet is more profitable when one operates multiple accounts with various bookies. In doing these, a bettor will be able to explore the different gains these bookies offer. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wondering what value betting is all about?
