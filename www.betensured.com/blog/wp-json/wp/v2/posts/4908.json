Teams are trying to\nbring in players that can make them better and help them forget the disappointment\nof the last season or give them more a successful previous season, depending\non&nbsp; where the team you support falls under.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is, the one thing that makes every football fan\ngiddy with excitement and huge anticipation during every off-season: transfers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, as sport-lovers, the only thing you have before and\nafter every game \u2013 and every window \u2013 is hope. Let us take Bayern Munich for\ninstance: treble winners, current Champions League holders, they still had\nLeroy Sane signed some months back. Then there is Chelsea: finished fourth\nplace in the English Premier League, level on points with third place, signed\n(so far) Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell (today) and it still seems that\nother signings would come through. There is also Manchester United: finished\nthird, Europa League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-finalists; signed no players.\nThen there is Barcelona, a club where new signings have not quite cut the\nmustard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, signing players does not necessarily equate to an\nimproved season, but the anticipation of the new season with new signings and\nthe potential of things that can be fuels an anticipation before and during the\nseason that cannot be matched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, sports \u2013 football included- is nothing without its\nviewers, without its fans. The hype, the excitement, the joy, the cheers, the\nroars, the disappointments, the near-misses, the euphoria, the despair, the\nanticipation, the uncertainty and the hope are the things everybody \u2013 players\ninclusive- live for. This is why fans check websites, purchase paraphernalia,\ngo to stadiums, go to bars (sometimes), listen to podcasts, live in certain\ncommunities and so on. The list is endless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every fan always looks forward to the start of the new\nseason. The period of new beginnings. All is forgiven, everything is reset. The\nhope of new positive things to come. The hope that the new \u2013 and old- signings\ncan deliver as we go to the stadiums to watch them or sit in bars or our houses\nto watch on prepaid TV. All we have is hope. Let us pray that it does not \u2018kill\nus\u2019.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now, the clock has been reset. Every team is back to the drawing board.
