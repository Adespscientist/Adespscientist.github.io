The title has been won and there\u2019s still plenty to be won and lost at\neither end of the table as the 2019\/20 seasons edges towards its conclusion. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of football has changed since\n\u2018Project Restart\u2019 began with no fans, backroom staff wearing face masks,\nmid-half drink breaks and the disinfectant of equipment. This is all part of\nthe new normal for football, but has all the change left the Premier League\nseason as a disappointment? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find comparisons on the latest odds on\nany of the remaining Premier League fixtures this season, check them out <a href=\"https:\/\/oddspedia.com\/football\/\">at Oddspedia<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the earlier games of the restart, it was\nclear that games were scrappier and less entertaining. It was questionable how\nfit the players were and comparisons were being made with the pace of\npre-season friendlies. This certainly showed in the first round of results with\nthree 0-0 draws between Aston Villa and Sheffield United, Everton and Liverpool\nand Leicester and Brighton. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as the games have picked up momentum, there has been no lack of action on the pitch with plenty of high scoring fixtures. This weekend, Manchester United played out a sensational 5-2 thriller against Bournemouth, while Chelsea and Leicester both won 3-0. Last week, Sheffield United stunned Tottenham 3-1 and West Ham and Chelsea played out a dramatic game with the Hammers coming from behind to win 3-2 so there certainly hasn\u2019t been a lack of action in the past few weeks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/epl-weekend-preview-match-week-26\/\">EPL Preview Match 26<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With most teams now having something to\nplay for, as the points and league positions are so close, the competition is\nbecoming fiercer throughout the league. The European places still need to be\nsettled and five teams continue to battle against relegation. This adds to\ntension and drama heading into the final weeks of the campaign. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Norwich face Watford and West\nHam within five days this week, fixtures which could determine the league\nstatus for all of these teams next year. Near the top, Wolves and Sheffield\nUnited paly each other in the race for Europe and Arsenal play Leicester as the\nGunners look to make a late run for the top eight. Even teams like Everton and\nNewcastle, in 11<sup>th<\/sup> and 12<sup>th<\/sup>, can still make the European\nplaces. Such competition in the league adds to the entertainment value and this\nwould have been lacking if the season was declared null and void earlier in the\nyear. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only clear disappointment of the\nPremier League return has been the lack of fans. While the league and\nbroadcasters have done all they can to make it a realistic experience with\ncanned crowd noises and sound effects, it really isn\u2019t the same. Many have\ntheir preference and opinions on the option of crowd noises, but watching a\nmatch without it feels like a Sunday league game being played at the local\npark. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was especially felt when Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 4-0 last month to take their biggest step towards winning the league. Anfield would have been full to the brim and the Kop electric, but, in some ways, these shared moments between fans and players now go missing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/english-premier-league-predictions\/\">English Premier League Predictions<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Has the premier league season restart been a disappointment?
