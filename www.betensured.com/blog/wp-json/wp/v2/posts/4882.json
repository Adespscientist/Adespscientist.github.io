However, this hasn\u2019t stopped the Irish from coming\ntogether (figuratively) to support various causes in the last few months. In\nfact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.olbg.com\/ie\/insights\/irish-sport-fundraising\">research\nby OBLG found<\/a> that sports fundraising campaigns have raised over \u20ac2 Million\nbetween March and May of 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the data, we can see that 62% of campaigns were running\nduring this duration for causes related to COVID-19. These campaigns aimed to\nraise \u20ac1.3 Million. But by the end of their campaign, they managed to exceed\ntheir goals by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkbusiness.ie\/articles\/irish-embrace-sport-covid-19-lockdown-raise-money-charity\/\">\n52%, reaching over \u20ac2 Million<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also shows that 65% of these campaigns related to\nsports. In other words, sports societies, teams, and clubs organized these\ncampaigns. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Moffat, CEO of OLBG.com, commented on this data. He\nsaid that as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/advice-for-public\">COVID-19<\/a>\nhas put a stop to all traditionally organized charity events related to sports.\nHowever, people really came together to support those who are working on the\nfront lines of the pandemic. Although these hard times physically push us\nfarther from sports, these sports have a way to pull us back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How People Got Involved<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Running and walking has been the most popular activity,\nwhich made up to 76% of exercise focusing on fundraising campaigns. 9% of those\nfundraising activities were the combination of cycling and running. In the\nstudy, we found that fundraises covered over 225,000km. Each kilometer that\nthey covered raised \u20ac6.37.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those fundraisers was Kathleen, who is 90 years old\nand raised more than\u20ac18,000 for the cause. She raised that amount by dancing in\nthe front garden. Furthermore, we saw Michel who did 1,000 pushups in just an\nhour and raised \u20ac17,850<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exceeding the Goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The combined goal of these fundraising campaigns was \u20ac2.7\nMillion in the study. But the final raised mount exceeded the goal by 70%,\nhitting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wheel.ie\/news\/2020\/06\/irish-citizens-embrace-sports-raise-over-eu2-million-covid-19-causes\">more\nthan \u20ac4.5 Million<\/a>.
