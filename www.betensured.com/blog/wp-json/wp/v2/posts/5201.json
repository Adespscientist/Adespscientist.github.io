Sorted. Automatic promotion? Sorted. Playoff spots? Sorted. Teams you&#8217;d forgotten existed that will spend next year letting their fanbase down and doing the same thing? Pretty much sorted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just one round of fixtures left in the second tier&#8217;s 2020\/21 campaign, where&#8217;s all the drama and madness?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahhhh, not a single team has been relegated yet. There it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four teams are fighting it out for the last remaining survival spot, and two of the said four couples are facing each other this Saturday. It&#8217;s going to be entertaining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many variables to be considered heading into game week 46, we&#8217;ve taken a look at the four teams involved in this season&#8217;s relegation dogfight and outlined exactly what they need to do to retain their Championship status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Derby County<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Position: 21st<br>Points: 43<br>Goal Difference: -22<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Wayne Rooney was handed the Derby manager&#8217;s job on a full-time basis last November, the Rams&#8217; campaign enjoyed a mini resurgence as they went unbeaten in six.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they&#8217;ve slipped back into their old ways and just one win in their last 14 outings &#8211; including six defeats on the spin &#8211; leaves them lingering perilously above the drop zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re three points above every team in the bottom three, though they have a worse goal difference than Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham, while the Millers have a game in hand and Rooney&#8217;s men face the Owls on the final day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they need to do to survive?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Derby&#8217;s task is simple &#8211; don&#8217;t get beaten against Wednesday at Pride Park, and they&#8217;ll survive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Derby does get beaten on Saturday and Rotherham wins, then Wayne Rooney&#8217;s men are down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rotherham<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Position: 22nd<br>Points: 40<br>Goal Difference: -16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper Rotherham look to have a pretty decent chance of survival given they&#8217;ve got a game in hand to play on their rivals, though they had about three games in hand over their opponents a few weeks ago, and they&#8217;ve blown most of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warne&#8217;s side saw a host of their games canceled earlier this season amid the coronavirus pandemic, and their survival bid has possibly been hampered as they&#8217;ve had to shoehorn their extra games into such a short period in the latter part of the campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they need to do to survive?<br>Rotherham&#8217;s destiny is out of their own hands after they fail to capitalize on their game at hand on Thursday. They&#8217;ll be hoping things don&#8217;t go well in Derby&#8217;s match, and they get a win at Cardiff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three points from their final outing will also likely be enough if Sheffield Wednesday beat Derby and don&#8217;t bag a ridiculous amount of goals &#8211; which is highly unlikely<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sheffield Wednesday<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Position: 23rd<br>Points: 40<br>Goal Difference: -21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three managers in a single season probably give you an indication as to how Wednesday&#8217;s campaign has gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If their 12-point penalty hadn&#8217;t been reduced to six following appeal they&#8217;d be down by now, but they head into the final day with a fighting chance of survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last Saturday&#8217;s home clash against out-of-form Nottingham Forest looked to be a must-win, and when Derby took the lead at Swansea later that afternoon, the Owls were down, though Rooney&#8217;s men&#8217;s collapse gave Darren Moore&#8217;s side a second bite at the cherry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they need to do to survive?<br>Wednesday&#8217;s task is simple &#8211; they have to beat Derby to stand any chance of survival, and even then, it may prove to be too little too late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they do beat Derby, their survival hopes are assured. They are remaining two clashes. Moore&#8217;s men do now have their destinies in their hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wycombe Wanderers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Position: 24th<br>Points: 40<br>Goal Difference: -33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll level with you here &#8211; Wycombe is down, but I couldn&#8217;t resist the opportunity to look at a picture of Gareth Ainsworth&#8217;s glorious locks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The writing was on the wall for the Chairboys after they lost all of their first seven games of the season, and this Saturday, they&#8217;ll finally be put out of their misery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they need to do to survive?<br>A miracle. Or\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Hope Sheffield Wednesday beat Derby on Saturday.<\/li><li>Beat Middlesbrough at least 14-0 (possibly more depending on Rotherham&#8217;s results).<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck, lads!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":1,\"permalink\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.betensured.com\\\/blog\\\/the-championship-relegation-battle\\\/\"}' class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img data-attachment-id=\"5202\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/the-championship-relegation-battle\/relegation-battle\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,472\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"relegation-battle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"472\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?resize=640%2C472&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5202\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?resize=640%2C472&#038;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/?attachment_id=5202\" class=\"wp-image-5202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?resize=80%2C60&amp;ssl=1 80w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/relegation-battle.jpg?resize=569%2C420&amp;ssl=1 569w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EDITORIAL kaka@betensured.com What each team in the Championship relegation battle needs to do to survive&#8230; Considering it is regularly lauded as the maddest, weirdest, and most unpredictable league in the world, a glance at this season&#8217;s Championship table kind of dispels all those old tropes.
