One season? Two? A decade?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing is for sure, the moment you stand in the dugout, your clock starts ticking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Arteta, the sound of the clock is more ominous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things do not seem to be working for Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making some astute signings during the transfer window, things were looking very bright for Arsenal especially after coming off the back of an FA Cup win and a Community Shield win against Liverpool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was in early September.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in the Premier League, the results read P11W4D1L6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have also scored 10 goals and conceded 14 times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have also lost 3 times -in 5 games \u2013 at home already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have also failed to score in 5 of their last 7 Premier League games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arsenal is last on the table in the \u2018chances created\u2019 column.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another damning stat: Arsenal has had the fewest second half shots of all the 92 teams in the English Football League this season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the ever-dependable Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last scored a goal from open play in the first League game on the season. Since then, he has added only one more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, the Arsenal does not score as much as before and still cannot defend as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that all down to the players and not the coach?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major concern is the lack of creativity on the pitch. It always seems very straightforward to defend against this current Arsenal side. At the moment, the absence of Mesut Ozil from the squad altogether is even more glaring as there is virtually no penetration from the midfield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, Arsenal sent in almost 50 crosses, none of which resulted in testing the Tottenham keeper between the sticks. It was also concerning that the strikers in Arsenal\u2019s current books do not possess the aerial prowess to encourage sending in a lot of crosses from out wide. Olivier Giroud would have been the best player for that strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also seems that the current Arsenal structure is rigid and possesses very little technicality. It is seemingly full of running and involves the full backs to get very high up the pitch. The current question is: when the full backs do not deliver, should a plan B not suffice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently so many concerns about this current iteration of Arsenal. Do the Arsenal fans and the board need to be patient with the Coach? Does it have to get worse before it gets better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are the players to blame for this shocking collapse (let us admit it, nobody thought that Arsenal would be struggling to score goals against practically every Premier League team)?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will the solution to Arsenal problems be the signing of more players if the tactics remain the same?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions, questions, questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, Mikel Arteta gets the chance to provide answers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And provide them soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How long does a manager need before he begins to get seriously scrutinized?
