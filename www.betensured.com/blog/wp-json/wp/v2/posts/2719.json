Conte said he did not count on me for next season.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking after Spain&#8217;s 2-2 draw with Colombia on Wednesday, Costa added: &#8220;My relationship with the coach has been bad this season. It&#8217;s a shame, I&#8217;ve already forwarded the message to Chelsea people to decide.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You have to find a team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Brazil-born Spain international Costa joined Chelsea from Atletico Madrid for a reported \u00a332m in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>He spent four seasons at Atleti and suggested he might be open to a return, despite the La Liga club being banned from signing players until the January transfer window<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Being five months without playing? I do not know, it&#8217;s complicated, but people know that I love Atletico a lot and that I love to live in Madrid,&#8221; Costa said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be nice to go back, but it&#8217;s difficult to be four or five months without playing. It&#8217;s a World Cup year and there are many things to think about.
