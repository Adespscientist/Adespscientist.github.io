The change was made in the middle of the season. They\nwere top of the La Liga, although they just lost in the Spanish Super Cup to\nAtletico Madrid. A relatively irrelevant game in the grand scheme of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, according to sources, Valverde\u2019s style\nof play did not sit well with the Barcelona faithful. However, it seemed like\nhis only downfall- or downfalls- were the second-leg defeats to Roma and Liverpool\nin the 2018 and 2019 Champions League seasons respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first question goes thus: if Valverde\nand Barcelona won at least on Champions League medal while he was in charge,\nwould he have been fired with the same reasons that were given?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Setien, the results read thus:\nP4W3L1. Not a bad record for a new manager. However, when you take over from a\nManager that was joint top in the League, top at the group stages of the\nChampions League, those results are nothing extraordinary. Admittedly, the\nManager needs time to understand his team and adjust accordingly. However, this\nis Barcelona, the clock is already ticking. Just ask Mr. Valverde.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, prior to Ernesto Valverde\ntaking over at Barcelona, he managed Athletic Bilbao- his second spell there-\nwhere he had a very good record, obviously defeating Barcelona in the Spanish\nSuper Cup during his spell there being one of them. While in Barcelona, he won\nconsecutive League titles, winning a double in his first season. Obviously, the\ndecision made by Barcelona in hindsight seemed a more philosophical one than a\nresults one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Setien, he possesses less coaching\nsuccess compared to Valverde- a risk on Barcelona\u2019s part. However, the brand of\nfootball his team plays \u2013 albeit without winning trophies- seems to be what\nBarcelona fell in love with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This obviously brings up the old question\nof style versus substance. Would you rather manage a team, play a certain way\nat the expense of consistently winning or would you discard all the aesthetics\nand focus solely on winning? We obviously now what Barcelona has decided. It\nseems like there are more troubling issues in Barcelona- like the endless\nsearch for who would replace one of the greatest ever footballers when he\nleaves\/retires. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would see how this love story goes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In case you have not noticed, Barcelona is under new Management.
