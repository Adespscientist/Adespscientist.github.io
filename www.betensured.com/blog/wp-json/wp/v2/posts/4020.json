The outcomes of each must be correct for a payment to be made. Odds are multiplied for each selection meaning that big wins can be made from small wagers, but it becomes increasingly unlikely the more selections are made.<strong>Also known as:<\/strong>&#8216;<em>Acca<\/em>&#8216; or &#8216;<em>Multiple<\/em>&#8216;<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Multiples<\/li>\n<li><strong>Action<\/strong><br \/>\nAction is an american term that refers to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinnacle.com\/en\/betting-articles\/Baseball\/ultimate-baseball-betting-guide\/JU3J9V9HPREQ3VMS\">baseball betting<\/a>, where a certain starting pitcher must be present in the starting lineup for the bet to stand or &#8216;see action&#8217;. Starting pitcher requirements usually only apply to moneyline bets.If you bet on a moneyline selection with a starting pitcher requirement and the pitcher does not start \/ there is a pitcher change, the bet is usually &#8216;pushed&#8217; (stake is returned to you and the bet is void).The reason for action only being seen if the starting pitcher starts is that the starting pitcher in a game of baseball can greatly affect the outcome of the game and so a change of pitcher can result in a large change in odds for the team affected.As a general rule, if you see a pitcher&#8217;s name listed next to a moneyline bet, you should assume that the bet you are placing will be subject to &#8216;starting pitcher&#8217; rules regarding whether the bet sees action or not. As always, see the terms and conditions of the bookmaker&#8217;s site for confirmation of this &#8211; usually terms relating to baseball will be listed under a &#8216;Rules&#8217; or &#8216;Sports betting rules&#8217; section of the terms and conditions pages.Occasionally there will be the option to choose between two types of bet &#8211; pitcher (usually the pitcher&#8217;s name will be listed &#8211; eg &#8216;Doe, J&#8217; for a starting pitcher called &#8216;John Doe&#8217;) or no pitcher. If you select the no pitcher option then the bet stands no matter whether the listed starting pitcher starts the game or not &#8211; the odds for this selection are usually adjusted to account for this, or they are similar to the &#8216;SP&#8217; horse racing bet type whereby the price of the bet is only applied at the start of the baseball game when it&#8217;s known which pitchers are starting.Starting pitcher requirements on baseball betting is most common on US sportsbetting sites. Many European betting sites will not list the starting pitchers at all, no matter which pitcher starts, the bet will stand.Starting pitcher requirements can be a potential hazard for matched bettors, since if bets are placed on the moneyline for both teams at different bookmakers but then one team&#8217;s designated starting pitcher fails to start, that bet will be voided\/pushed but the other bet will still stand. Therefore the remaining bet stake that sees &#8216;action&#8217; is left &#8216;at risk&#8217; \/ is not &#8216;hedged&#8217; unless a new bet is struck to replace the voided bet.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advantage Play<\/strong><br \/>\nGambling with the odds stacked in your favour, be it from enhanced odds, promotional bonuses, refunds on losses or &#8220;what if&#8221; results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Against the spread (ATS)<\/strong><br \/>\nA wager placed against the handicap.Similar to &#8216;beating the spread&#8217; &#8211; a term used to describe a team or player beating the handicap that was applied to them. For example, if you bet on Atlanta to beat Cincinnati with an 8.5 point spread and Atlanta won the game by 10 points, you would say that Atlanta &#8216;beat the spread&#8217; (since they scored 10 points &#8211; 1.5 points more than the 8.5 spread).<strong>See also:<\/strong>Handicap\u00a0and\u00a0Spread Betting<\/li>\n<li><strong>After Timing<\/strong><br \/>\nTaking credit for (or boasting about) predicting a result correctly after the event has finished, without having mentioned the prediction prior to the start of the event. Quite often a technique employed by tipsters to make it appear that they are more successful than they really are &#8211; ie posting a string of apparently successful results after the event has finished, despite having never posted these &#8216;picks&#8217; prior to the start of the event (so the veracity of these so-called picks cannot be verified).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All in<\/strong><br \/>\nPoker term &#8211; &#8220;to go all in&#8221; is to bet all your chips on the result of a single hand.

For example, if the price in beans changed on the East coast of America and an individual could somehow relay that information on to a counterpart in the West coast quicker than the market could be updated in the West, the counterpart in the West coast could buy or sell quickly, wait for the price to change, and then trade out of the position for a profit.<strong>Also known as:<\/strong>&#8216;<em>Arb<\/em>&#8216;<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Sharbing<\/li>\n<li><strong>Asian Handicap<\/strong><br \/>\nNamed for its Eastern origin, an Asian handicap reduces the number of lines on a (possibly draw resulting) sporting event from 3 (win, lose, draw) to just 2 (win, lose) by assigning a handicap of a number of goals to one side. This simplifies the betting options to two outcomes with near 50% chance of success on each.The number of goals or points applied as the handicap can be full, half, or quarter:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a\u00a0<strong>full handicap<\/strong>, a full goal or point is applied as handicap.<\/li>\n<li>In a\u00a0<strong>half handicap<\/strong>, a half goal or point is applied as handicap.<\/li>\n<li>In a\u00a0<strong>quarter handicap<\/strong>, the bet stake is effectively split in two, with half the bet stake placed on a full goal\/point handicap bet and the other half bet stake placed on a half goal\/point handicap bet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All asian handicaps are a transformation of one of the above options with the goal \/ point handicaps incremented by one goal\/point (ie (+\/-)0, +\/-0.25, +\/-0.5, +\/-0.75, +\/-1, +\/-1.25, etc).<\/p>\n<p>The notation for asian handicapping bets is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full handicap:<\/strong>1AH(1) or 1AH(-1)<br \/>\nRefers to a full goal advantage (1 or +1) or handicap (-1) applied to team 1.Note, a &#8216;special case&#8217; of full goal handicap is the &#8216;zero&#8217; goal &#8211; 1AH(0) &#8211; handicap, whereby if a game is drawn, all bets on the zero goal handicap are &#8216;pushed&#8217; (ie stakes are returned). 1AH(0) can be dutched with bets on the draw and team 2 to win to &#8216;lock in&#8217; a return (be careful though, a specialized calculation is required, it is not the same as dutching plain &#8216;1&#215;2&#8217;).1AH(0) is the same as betting on the Draw No Bet \/ DNB bet type. Also known as &#8216;Moneyline&#8217; in US betting parlance (although some vendors such as Pinnacle may supply both moneyline and AH(0) offerings).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Half handicap:\u00a0<\/strong>1AH(0.5) or 1AH(-0.5)<br \/>\nRefers to a half goal advantage (0.5, sometimes denoted +0.5) or handicap (-0.5) applied to team 1 (although confusingly on Asian handicap specialist sites, the handicapped side is often just referred to as &#8216;0.5&#8217; &#8211; ie when you bet on that you are betting on that selection with a handicap of -0.5).1AH(0.5) is the same as betting on the European Handicap 1EH(1) or on the 1X &#8216;second chance&#8217; bet type. 1AH(0.5) can be &#8216;dutched&#8217; against a regular bet on Team 2.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quarter handicap:<\/strong>1AH(0.25) or 1AH(-0.25)<br \/>\nRefers to a bet where the stake is split, with half the stake bet on 1AH(0) and half the stake bet on 1AH(0.5). The two parts of the bet are effectively settled as one at the price you bet at.With the quarter handicap, if you bet on 1AH(0.25) (ANY quarter bet handicap) and the result is a draw, half your stake will be pushed (stake returned to you) and half will win. If you bet on 1AH(0.25) and team 1 wins, you win both &#8216;parts&#8217; of the quarter handicap bet.Note &#8211; quarter handicaps include 0.75 as well which is a bet where half the bet is placed on the 0.5 handicap and half on the 1 handicap.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Invariably with a true asian handicap specialist you will never see odds straying outside of 1.5 to 3 decimal because the handicap is adjusted so as to make the two possible outcomes as equal as possible (which is after all the point of an asian handicap!). If the odds drift too far away from evens, it is more common for a proper\/true asian specialist to move the handicap rather than (just) the line\/odds. Often you can see hilarious &#8216;faux&#8217; asian odds on European sites where the odds are miles away from evens (ie 1.1 vs 8) &#8211; European bookmakers are generally poor at offering Asian handicaps and this can be a rich vein occasionally for the arb hunter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also known as:<\/strong>\u00a0&#8216;<em>Handicap Betting, Spread Betting<\/em>&#8216;<\/p>\n<p><strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Middles<\/p>\n<p><strong>B<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Back<\/strong><br \/>\nBetting on a particular outcome.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Lay<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad beat<\/strong><br \/>\nA tough loss, normally in poker, where one is statistically the strong favourite to win the hand but then goes on to lose as a result of another weaker player hitting a lucky card\/street.Also known as &#8216;sucking out&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Back \/ Lay Spread<\/strong><br \/>\nThe back lay spread is a term used to describe the difference in price between the back and lay prices within a market on a betting exchange.

Standard procedure is to have this in a separate account, normally an e-wallet.As a professional gambler your &#8216;bankroll&#8217; may not necessarily (indeed, should most certainly NOT!) be the full amount that you risk in any one session of gambling. For example, in poker it is common to organize your bankroll in such a way that you only ever take 1-5% of your full bankroll to a table to play with (which in turn is a function of the table limits). The reasons for this are so that one can &#8216;ride out&#8217; the variance involved in gambling (ie although someone may be technically better than others at poker, it is prudent to allow for the inevitable ups and downs involved by playing with a limited bankroll that is a small proportion of your total bankroll so as not to &#8217;tilt&#8217;).Similar principles apply to Sportsbetting and Casino wagering.<strong>See also:<\/strong>e-wallet<\/li>\n<li><strong>Basic Blackjack Strategy<\/strong><br \/>\nAn optimal strategy for playing Blackjack whereby a minimal loss can be expected all things being equal.

A binary market offers selections or bets where there are just two (hence the term &#8216;binary&#8217;) distinct results, win or lose.Binary odds are displayed on a scale from 0 to 100, with the odds roughly equating to the probability of the outcome occuring (with 0 being the price on an outcome that will not happen and 100 being the price on an outcome that is certain to happen).Bets are placed on a binary market by either buying or selling &#8216;points&#8217; on the market &#8211; so for example if the BUY price on a binary market is 40 and you bet \u00a31 per point on the market (your stake is 40*\u00a31=\u00a340), you stand to win \u00a3100 if the bet wins (so a profit of the winning amount &#8211; \u00a3100 &#8211; less the initial stake &#8211; \u00a340 &#8211; which equals \u00a360). Alternatively if you SELL at \u00a31 per point at the same price of 40 (your stake here is \u00a31*(100-40)=\u00a360), and the selection wins, you will lose your \u00a360 stake.The &#8216;converse&#8217; to the example above &#8211; if the selection loses, your BUY bet will lose (you lose \u00a340), but your SELL bet will win \u00a3100 (so your profit on the market is \u00a3100-\u00a360=\u00a340).A betting exchange is based on the principles of binary betting, each selection within a market can either win or lose and individuals can bet with one another on whether each selection within each market will win or lose (backing and laying respectively). BUYing and SELLing on a binary market also interchanges with backing and laying on an exchange.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Burlington Bertie<\/strong><br \/>\nTic Tac term for odds of 100\/30.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Odds Guaranteed<\/strong><br \/>\nA promotional offer on horse racing whereby the bookmaker promises to pay out on your horse racing bet at the start price if that price is higher than the price that you took the bet at originally.Example: you bet on a horse at 2\/1 but the price of the horse when the race started was 3\/1 &#8211; if the bookmaker offers &#8220;Best Odds Guaranteed&#8221; then you will be paid out at 3\/1 instead of just 2\/1.<strong>Also known as:<\/strong><em>BOG<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Betting<\/strong><br \/>\nThe placing of wagers on the outcome of events.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Betting exchange<\/strong><br \/>\nOrganisations that allow customers to bet and take bets against each other such as Betfair, BetDaq and Smarkets.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Betting Strategy<\/strong><br \/>\nA method or system employed to attain a specific result within betting activity &#8211; usually to win!Since all gaming operators work on the principle of vig\/house edge\/overround, most betting strategies employed by punters are not likely to succeed in the short to medium term. Even with strategies that, in theory at least, are profitable in the long term (such as the Martingale system), in reality even these strategies are destined to fail because the amount of time and money required to see a long term profit is vast.The only way to ensure long term profits is to play with an advantage of some sort &#8211; eg making use of promotional bonuses that are offered by gaming operators to effectively improve the odds or increase the value of the lines that are offered.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid Offer Spread<\/strong><br \/>\nThe difference between the bid price (selling) and offer price (buying), normally for a commodity or equity.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Back \/ Lay Spread<\/li>\n<li><strong>Big player<\/strong><br \/>\nAnyone that places large wagers.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Whale<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bingo<\/strong><br \/>\nGame of chance involving the drawing of numbers.

The WR on these bonuses used to be relatively high, so the best way of approaching it was to attempt to bust out your full balance on the very first bet.By &#8216;knocking together&#8217; two similar US books where you had bonuses at both, you could easily get a good run going where you had bonus after bonus within days of each other across just those two books, busting alternatively from one book to another, to another, etc, reloading for new bonuses continuously. Heady days.Example: a bookie has a bonus of 100% to \u00a3100 with a 5x deposit+bonus WR &#8211; one might employ the bustomatic strategy by underlaying the first &#8216;full balance&#8217; (\u00a3200) bet heavily.In this way you would either make a smaller profit of \u00a350 if the first bet loses (in which case no further wagering is required) or else make a much larger profit if it wins (in which case the full 5x(D+B) WR must be completed, but this enhanced profit compensates you for having to spend the time and effort in completing the WR and helps to cover any losses incurred in completing the WR).<strong>See also:<\/strong>Wagering Requirement<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Betting Strategy<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Expected Value<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>C<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Canadian<\/strong><br \/>\nSee Super Yankee.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Canbet<\/strong><br \/>\nAn Australian bookmaker, regulated by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\/news-action-and-statistics\/Match-fixing-and-sports-integrity\/Sports-Betting-Intelligence-Unit.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gambling Commission<\/a> in the UK, that at the end of 2013 stopped honouring withdrawals back to customer accounts; first citing system and then funding issues.

In this way, no matter what the outcome of an event, the betting exchange always turns a profit (since when one person loses, another one always wins and has to pay commission on their profit).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comps<\/strong><br \/>\nShort for &#8216;complementary gifts&#8217;. Gifts given to gamblers in an effort to keep them gambling. Notable in Las Vegas for providing everything from rooms to limousines, to keep the Whales coming back.

Fractiontal odds of 10\/11 would be displayed in decimal as 10\/11 + 1 = 0.91 (recurring) + 1 = 1.91.Decimal odds are also known as &#8220;European&#8221; odds (in contrast to &#8220;English&#8221; (Fractional) odds) &#8211; decimal odds are often denoted as &#8216;EU&#8217; on bookmaking sites where the option exists to change the odds display (again, in contrast to &#8216;EN&#8217; for Fracional\/English odds).<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0American Odds\u00a0and\u00a0Fractional Odds<\/li>\n<li><strong>Degenerate<\/strong><br \/>\nA compulsive gambler, mug.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Mugging<\/li>\n<li><strong>Double Carpet<\/strong><br \/>\nTic Tac term for odds of 33\/1, a single Carpet is 3\/1.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Double Up<\/strong><br \/>\nDoubling your stake after a loss.More commonly, in AP parlance, refers to the strategy of target betting whereby one would attempt to double up your balance very quickly and then grind out the rest of a wagering requirement.In blackjack, to double up means to place a side bet on a hand whereby if you win, you receive double the profit &#8211; see\u00a0Basic Blackjack Strategy.<strong>Also known as:<\/strong>&#8216;<em>Double or Nothing or Double or Quits<\/em>&#8216;<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Target Betting<\/li>\n<li><strong>Draw<\/strong><br \/>\nA match that finishes even \/ with both teams or sides scoring the same number of &#8216;points&#8217;.<strong>See also:<\/strong>1X2<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Dead Heat<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Push<\/li>\n<li><strong>Draw No Bet<\/strong><br \/>\nA bet type where the stake is returned if the event bet on is a draw.

This is essentially the definition of a &#8216;complete book&#8217; or &#8216;complete market&#8217;.Asian handicapping lines can offer extra value when dutching. Taking advantage of the extremely tight handicap lines offered by asian books, one can &#8216;lay off&#8217; a &#8216;1&#8217; or &#8216;2&#8217; bet (ie a back bet on one team or another) by dutching it with a bet on the draw, plus another bet on the other team to win with a handicap applied.

The odds on the place will be expressed as a fraction of the win odds.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Edge<\/strong><br \/>\nThe profit that the house expects to make on a game. The edge is calculated by subtracting the expected return from 100. Different games have a different edge. Blackjack has a very low house edge (approximately 0.5%), whereas slot machines have a very high edge (varies widely from 5-20%).

The bettor receives a return of their stake in addition to the odds*stake shown. Odds greater than even are read or spoken &#8216;x to y&#8217; (for odds of x\/y) &#8211; odds less than even are read or spoken &#8216;x to y on&#8217; (for odds of y\/x).For example, a bet of \u00a310 at odds of 2\/1 (read\/spoken as &#8220;two to one&#8221;) would return \u00a330 (\u00a320 win + \u00a310 stake returned). Odds of 1\/4 (read\/spoken as &#8220;four to one on&#8221;) would return \u00a312.50 for the same \u00a310 stake (\u00a32.50 win + \u00a310 stake returned).Fractional odds are also known as &#8220;English Odds&#8221; because the use of fractional odds begain in England.On many bookmaker sites, one has the option to change the odds display to Fractional by selecting &#8216;EN&#8217; from the &#8216;odds display&#8217; settings (compare this to &#8216;EU&#8217; for European (ie decimal) odds and &#8216;US&#8217; for American Odds &#8211; other odds formats include Malay, where odds are always expressed in decimal numbers under + or &#8211; 1 &#8211; ie +0.4 in Malay odds = 1.4 in decimal, 2\/5 in Fractional and -250 in American).<strong>See also:<\/strong>Decimal Odds\u00a0and\u00a0American Odds<\/li>\n<li><strong>Free Bet<\/strong><br \/>\nA &#8216;free bet&#8217; is a promotional device used by gaming operators to induce individuals to play at their outlets. Most commonly a free bet or bets will be given to individuals after completing a certain wagering requirement &#8211; for example &#8216;deposit and spend \u00a3100 to get a \u00a3100 free bet&#8217;.From the gaming operator&#8217;s perspective, the ultimate hope is that in the process of completing the wagering requirement, the individual will lose more than the value of the free bet and thus will represent a profitable situation for the operator.In contrast, the Advantage Player or Matched Bettor will attempt to extract the value of the free bet with as little loss as possible by strategically placing matched bets (backing at the bookmaker and laying the bets off at an exchange).Free bets are commonly referred to as &#8216;stake not returned&#8217; or &#8216;SNR&#8217; free bets. Free bets are usually applied to an individual&#8217;s account as a &#8216;virtual&#8217; entity &#8211; if the bet wins, only the winnings are returned to the individual, the value of the stake is not returned as normally would be the case with a regular bet.As a result, when laying off an SNR free bet it is important to underlay your bet to compensate for the fact that the stake is not returned (in essence this equates to laying off the bet at &#8216;odds-1&#8217;).The value of an SNR free bet is best extracted at longer odds (if they are being &#8216;matched off&#8217; or &#8216;layed off&#8217; at an exchange to extract their value). The reason for this can be best seen by doing &#8216;what if&#8217; scenarios with free bets \/ lay bets at different odds &#8211; for example do a &#8216;what if&#8217; scenario for a free bet at odds of 1.5 with lay odds of 1.5, then compare the results to the same free bet placed at odds of 10 with lay odds of 10. At at longer odds, the percentage of the free bet you can expect to get back as profit is much greater than at shorter odds.Very occasionally, &#8216;free bets&#8217; will be applied to an account as non-SNR. Commonly this kind of free bet is referred to as a &#8216;Stake Returned&#8217; or &#8216;SR&#8217; free bet (since if you bet with the bonus amount, your stake will be returned to you with your winnings if your bet wins). In effect this kind of promotional bonus is simply an account credit &#8211; no underlay is required with this kind of free bet (although usually an additional wagering requirement will apply to the bonus amount so it may still be beneficial to underlay the first bet after you receive an SR free bet).Occasionally free bets will be awarded as a refund if your bet loses. In this case, you place the bet as &#8216;normal&#8217; with your own cash balance and if the bet loses, the operator will refund you the stake as an account credit. It is generally best to treat these kinds of bets the same as SNR free bets &#8211; ie back\/lay at long odds and underlay.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Underlaying<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Bustomatic Matched Betting Technique (for SR free bets)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Full Cover Bet<\/strong><br \/>\nA wager containing all permutations of doubles, trebles and accumulators for a given number of selections.

There are a total of 9 possible HT\/FT outcomes: 1\/1, 1\/X, 1\/2, X\/1, X\/X, X\/2, 2\/1, 2\/X and 2\/2 &#8211; where 1 is the home team, X is the draw and 2 is the away team.Example: &#8216;1\/X&#8217; would refer to a bet on the match where Team 1 (the home team) leads at the end of the first half but the match ends in a draw at the end of full time.Alternative notation is for the full names of the participant teams to be listed in the selection names &#8211; so for example if Man Utd were playing Arsenal, one might see the listings: Man Utd \/ Man Utd (Man Utd lead at the end of both halves), Man Utd \/ Draw (Man Utd win first half, full time result is a draw, Man Utd \/ Arsenal (Man Utd to lead at half time, Arsenal to win at the end of full time), etc etc.1\/1 and 2\/2 must not be confused with Correct Score market results like 1-1 or 2-2 (end score of &#8216;one all&#8217; or &#8216;two all&#8217;). Also not to be confused with bets on &#8216;second chance&#8217; &#8216;pseudo&#8217; asian handicap markets (where 1X means a bet on either team 1 or the draw happening).HT\/FT bets can also be the cause of great confusion when compared with the bet offering &#8216;To Win Both Halves&#8217; (which is a bet that effectively treats both halves of a football match as separate events). It is an error to believe that &#8216;1\/1&#8217; is the same as &#8216;Team 1 to win both halves&#8217;, this is NOT the case. Any temptation to bet on what looks like an arb on the &#8216;to win both halves&#8217; market (by backing a &#8216;to win both halves&#8217; bet at a bookmaker and laying it off on the HT\/FT market) should be avoided at all costs.Why? Take the following example:You bet on Team1 to win both halves and lay the bet off by laying 1\/1 on the HT\/FT market.Team 1 win the first half by 2 goals (half time score: 2-0) and Team 2 go on to score the only goal of the second half (full time score: 2-1). In this case, whilst Team 1 won the first half, and continued to win at the end of full time (so a bet on 1\/1 would have won), in actual fact a bet on &#8220;Team 1 to win both halves&#8221; would have lost (since Team 2 scored the only goal of the second half). In this case you would lose the &#8216;to win both halves&#8217; bet AND lose the 1\/1 lay bet.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Handicap<\/strong><br \/>\nA way of levelling a sporting event by applying a handicap of some sort (points or goals) to the starting position of the stronger team (one team starts a goal down for example) and adjusting the odds accordingly.Handicaps can be applied using a European or Asian methodology (respectively known as &#8220;European Handicap&#8221; (EH) and &#8220;Asian Handicap&#8221; (AH)).Handicaps can be applied to any sport which uses a points based system.Variations include Spread Betting and Asian Handicaps.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Spread Betting<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Asian Handicap<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0European Handicap<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hedging<\/strong><br \/>\nThe process of reducing potential losses or gains.

You are &#8216;laying&#8217; that back bet.To take a position that something won&#8217;t happen.<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Lay Liability<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lengthen<\/strong><br \/>\nTerm for the increase in odds where something becomes increasingly unlikely.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Drift<\/li>\n<li><strong>Liability \/ Lay Liability \/ Lay Liability Sharing<\/strong><br \/>\nPotential losses on a market. In simple terms, the amount of money you expect to lose (or have to pay out) if the bet you have backed (or laid) loses (or wins, in the case of a lay bet).Lay liability is the total amount you will lose if a bet you have laid then goes on to win. Lay liability is equivalent to the amount of money that the person that backed your bet will win (over and above their initial stake) &#8211; so for example if you lay a bet at decimal odds of 2 that Man Utd will not win and someone backs that bet with you (they accept or &#8216;strike&#8217; the bet with you) for a stake of \u00a3100, your lay liability is \u00a3100 (since if Man Utd lose, you will have to pay out \u00a3100 to the person that won the bet).Lay liability can become quite complicated &#8211; but is also very ueful to the professional matched bettor &#8211; in the case that you are laying more than one selection in the same event\/market, since the amount that you will potentially lose on the market differs depending on which selection wins. However the total lay liability for a market is always the largest amount you can expect to pay out to a single individual selection within the market.Example: if you have a lay bet of \u00a3100 on Man Utd at 2.0, plus a lay bet on the Draw of \u00a3100 at 3.5, then your total liability for that market is \u00a3250 because the largest amount you can expect to have to pay out on a single individual selection in the market is \u00a3250 (ie if the match ends in a Draw you will have to pay out \u00a3250).This concept is commonly referred to as &#8216;liability sharing&#8217; and has a number of positive benefits:Firstly it means that you can lay many bets on different selections within the same market so long as the total lay liability (refer to description above) does not exceed your current exchange balance. Additionally, for each extra selection you lay within a market, as long as the lay liability of that selection is lower than the current maximum liability in the market, no extra money needs to be &#8216;ringfenced&#8217; from your main exchange balance. This is very ueful if you have a number of bets on different horses within a horse race and you need to lay them all off &#8211; by using the same exchange, you can lay them all off and your total liability on the market will only be as much as the largest liability of any single horse in the race.Another advantage of liability sharing is that you can avoid paying any exchange commission if one of the horses you laid does go on to win (so long as the lay liability of that horse was larger than the largest lay stake of all the other horses you laid in the market). In the case that the lay liability is not larger than the largest lay stake of all the other lay bets in the market, you would still see a reduced commission bill (since your total profit for that market will have been reduced by the amount you had to pay out in lay liability on the horse that won).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limit \/ Win Limits<\/strong><br \/>\nThe amount you are permitted to wager on an event.

This is not the case &#8211; each spin is independent of every other spin and as such the likelihood of a red or a black being spun is the same from one spin to another (this is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Gambler&#8217;s Fallacy&#8221;).Over a large enough sample \/ number of spins, the number of reds and blacks will tend to be equal &#8211; however the &#8216;order&#8217; in which they turn up (ie variability) cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty based upon a knowledge of past results.

Hence if a price on a horse is 3\/1, to calculate the probability of the horse winning one would simply &#8216;flip&#8217; (odds+1) over to make 1\/4 &#8211; ie the horse has a 1 in 4 chance of winning (or 0.25 in decimal\/percentage terms).Additionally, in a perfect market (ie a market where the price on every selection is absolutely accurate), the sum of all probabilities will equal exactly one.This fairly trivial &#8211; albeit slightly technical &#8211; observation should be treated as absolutely invaluable knowledge to the professional APer, and it&#8217;s importance should most certainly NOT be trivialized! It IS the fundamental rule upon which all matched betting is built upon.Why? Well, for calculating arbitrage, knowing that the sum of all probabilities equals one allows you to take a price offered at one bookmaker, run a quick calculation and then know exactly what price the &#8216;other side&#8217; of the bet must be at or better than in order for the arb to be profitable.<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0True Odds<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Over Round<\/li>\n<li><strong>Odds on<\/strong><br \/>\nExpressed, in fractional terms, as 1\/X (where X is greater than 1).

If the figure is under 100% then the term overround is still used, but it would mean the bookmaker would make a loss if bets were taken evenly across all selections in the book.Used in arbing speak to describe an arb that is profitable &#8211; if the overround on an arb is under 100% then it&#8217;s a profitable arb.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Odds<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0True Odds<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>P<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Palp Bets<\/strong><br \/>\nA palp bet is a bet that was struck between a customer and a bookmaker, but then subsequently cancelled by the bookmaker because of an error in the validity of the bet at the time the bet was struck. Palped bets are a special case of void bet &#8211; palped bets are paid out at decimal odds of 1 (ie only the stake is returned) and the bet is effectively cancelled.Another type of palped bet is a bet where the original price was palpable (erroneous), but instead of the bet being cancelled after it won, the bet was paid out at what the price should have been at the time the bet was placed.Palped bets can be the scourge of the matched bettor because if a back bet is placed by the bettor, then laid off on an exchange, subsequently palped by the bookmaker, but then goes on to win, then the matched bettor will lose the lay liability but not receive any &#8216;back side&#8217; winnings since the bet was palped. As a result a loss equal to the lay liability is incurred on the transaction \/ matched bet. At longer odds this can entail a considerable loss.However very occassionally the converse of the above can hold true in as much as the bookmaker may palp a bet that goes on to lose, in which case a profit equal to the lay liability is made on the matched bet (this is effectively like hitting a\u00a0half middle).Unfortunately this happens very rarely since bookmakers quite often only palp bets after the event has occured and cynically will settle a palpable bet &#8216;normally&#8217; if it went on to lose &#8211; ie if it is a palpable bet, they will only palp it if it goes on to win (in which case they avoid having to pay out), but if it is a losing bet they will not palp it (in which case you lose the stake as normal).Bookmakers will usually have terms relating to palpable errors in their full Terms and Conditions. The professional matched bettor should take the time to read up on the subject by checking over T&amp;C with at least one bookmaker to understand better what a palpable error is.It is not uncommon to find an arb that is in fact a palpable error &#8211; most usually when the bookmaker has mixed up the odds on two similar but different selections &#8211; ie 1-0 and 0-1, or over 2.5 and under 2.5 etc. In such circumstances it is not good to blindly take these arbs without understanding the risks fully (especially at very long odds): one might consider backing but not laying at all in such circumstances depending on the nature of the bet (ie &#8216;does the bet represent very good value?&#8217; &#8211; if yes then it may be worth punting on this instead of back\/laying it). At the very least one should apply the &#8216;is it too good to be true?&#8217; test &#8211; if the answer is strongly &#8216;yes&#8217;, then caution should be exercised.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Void Bets<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parlay<\/strong><br \/>\nAmerican term for an Accumulator or Multiple or combo bet.

In a spread betting market, one would either buy or sell points on a binary betting &#8216;selection&#8217;.Financial spread betting is similar to exchange betting &#8211; indeed they are two different manifestations of the &#8216;binary betting&#8217; concept.For more information on Spread betting with handicaps, see the link below for &#8216;Against the Spread and for Asian Handicapping.For more information on the financial system, see the link below for &#8216;Binary Betting&#8217;.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Against the Spread<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Asian Handicapping<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Binary Betting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stake<\/strong><br \/>\nThe amount risked as a wager or bet on an event.For a back bet, the stake is the maximum amount a punter can expect to lose should the bet lose (eg bet \u00a310 on Team1 and if Team1 loses, you lose your \u00a310 stake).For a lay bet, the lay stake is the size of bet that you are prepared to accept from a backer and the corresponding lay liability for that stake is (odds-1)*stake (eg if you accept a lay stake of \u00a310 at odds of 2 decimal, the lay liability is also \u00a310 &#8211; for odds of 3 the lay liability would be \u00a320, etc).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Starting Price<\/strong><br \/>\nUsually refers to horse racing.

Most commonly applies to casino wagering requirements.The basic concept of target betting is that one places very large (often full balance) bets at the start of betting session with the aim of hitting a certain &#8216;target&#8217; balance quickly (and in the process making the value of the bonus a lot greater). Once the target balance is reached, the remainder of the wagering requirement is completed on minimal risk bets to avoid losing too much of the (now much greater) potential profit.There are several advantages to this technique which mean that target betting can increase the expected value of a bonus &#8211; in theory at least. However care must be taken to ensure that the risks of the strategy are fully understood and that the strategy is suitable for the particular wagering campaign one is about to undertake (for example it is not (as) suitable for a post wager casino bonus campaign).<strong>Also known as:<\/strong>&#8216;<em>tier or tiered betting&#8217;<\/em>.<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Betting Strategy<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Expected Value<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Wagering Requirement<\/li>\n<li><strong>Teaser<\/strong><br \/>\nAmerican term for taking a more favourable point spread and therefore lowering the evens pay-out.

There is no certainty you will profit from that bet &#8211; you could lose ten in a row, it is not impossible to lose 100 in a row &#8211; but statistically you should win half, and your payout will in the long run be greater than the losses, so the bet is &#8220;Value&#8221;.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Advantage Play<\/li>\n<li><strong>Variance<\/strong><br \/>\nThe change in your bankroll over time away from the Expected value (or EV) which it should follow. For example if you have 100 credits and play 185 spins of Roulette betting 1 unit on Red each time you should end with 95 due to the house edge. The fact at times your balance may be as high as 110 and as low as 85 is the &#8220;variance&#8221; away from the trend line.The term variance is also used in AP to refer to the &#8216;variability&#8217; of a particular type of gambling or type of game &#8211; for example slot machines are referred to as &#8216;high variance&#8217; because it can be possible to see very large swings either side of the &#8216;average&#8217; return expected (ie wagered amount less house edge), whereas other games such as Blackjack and Roulette are classed as low variance since the swings experienced will be a lot less pronounced. In this respect, variance is closely linked to risk &#8211; the higher the variance of a game, the more risk there is of busting your bankroll and vice versa for low variance games.This difference in variance and the associated risk between games can be exploited by the APer to undertake lengthy wagering sessions on low variance games so as to not risk losing too much of your initial bank roll whilst completing the wagering requirement. In response to this, casinos now tend to &#8216;weight&#8217; the contribution that wagering on certain types of games make to a wagering requirement &#8211; so for example it is not uncommon now to see games that can be played in a low risk way (such as Roulette) be weighted at a very low level &#8211; eg 10% &#8211; so that only 10% of all wagers actually count towards the wagering requirement (in effect this multiplies the wagering requirement by 10 if you decide to only use that game to complete the WR).As always it is imperative to check the T&amp;C fully before underaking a WR to ensure that value or EV of the bonus is worthwhile (ie, that the bonus wagering can be completed using a certain staking method\/game in such a way that on average you can expect to make a profit). See the TGT artcle below regarding calculating bonus EV for more information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vig (Vigorish)<\/strong><br \/>\nYidish slang used for bookmaker commission.

A bet can be voided for various reason, most usually if the selection that is bet on is a non-runner or if the bet was struck in error (in which case it is referred to as a &#8216;palpable error&#8217;, a &#8216;palp&#8217;, or a &#8216;palped bet&#8217;).<strong>See also:<\/strong>Palp<br \/>\n<strong>See also:<\/strong>\u00a0Non Runner<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>W<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wager<\/strong><br \/>\nThe stake placed on the outcome of an event. A bet placed on an outcome of an event.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Betting<\/li>\n<li><strong>Wagering Requirements<\/strong><br \/>\nAmount of Play-through required in order to convert a bonus to withdrawable cash.Most bonuses offered by gaming operators are subject to terms and conditions which define at what point the bonus can be withdrawn. The primary condition tied to most bonuses is that a certain amount of &#8216;wagering&#8217; must be completed before the bonus can be withdrawn &#8211; this is &#8216;the wagering requirement&#8217; of the bonus (commonly referred to in abbreviation as &#8216;WR&#8217;).The WR is usually expressed in multiples of the bonus and\/or deposited amount, and denoted accordingly NxB or Nx(D+B), where N is the multiplier, D is the deposited amount and B is the bonus amount.For example a bonus with a wagering requirement of 5xB means the bonus amount must be &#8216;turned over&#8217; or &#8216;wagered through&#8217; five times before it can be withdrawn. A bonus with a 5x(D+B) WR means the deposit AND bonus amounts must be wagered five times before the bonus can be withdrawn.The use of &#8216;D+B&#8217; in WR terms can be an underhand way for gaming operators to increase the amount of wagering that must be completed before a bonus can be withdrawn, whilst on the face of it in the basic promotional material making the bonus sound a lot more generous.For example consider the wording: &#8220;Get our great 5% bonus up to \u00a3100 with only 5x wagering!!!&#8221; &#8211; this is slightly disingenuous if it turns out that in the small print the actual WR is 5x(D+B), since to get\/release\/withdraw the full \u00a3100 bonus you would first have to deposit \u00a32,000, meaning the actual WR is 5x(2,000+100)=\u00a310,500 &#8211; an eye popping (and most likely -EV) 105x WR!).As always it is very important to read the T&amp;C fully, and to calculate the expected value (EV) of a bonus. A key element of this is translating any &#8216;D+B&#8217; wagering requirement into simple &#8216;B&#8217; terms (ie in the example above, converting the 5x(D+B) into 105xB).See the article linked to below for more information on calculating EV.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Bonus<\/li>\n<li><strong>Welch<\/strong><br \/>\nFailure to settle a gambling debt.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whale<\/strong><br \/>\nTerm for someone who has the bankroll to place large wagers (normally casino) and lose correspondingly large amounts.<strong>See also:<\/strong>Big Player<\/li>\n<li><strong>Winning margin<\/strong><br \/>\nDistance by which the winner was ahead of the runner-up.
