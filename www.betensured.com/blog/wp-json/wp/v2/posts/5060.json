This American thoroughbred horse race will allow audiences at the Gulfstream Park Racetrack on January 23, 2021. However, due to the coronavirus threat, the management will implement strict protocols for the spectators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to witness the race in person to watch your favorite horse in action, there are things that you need to remember. Continue reading to know what are the things that you need to remember during the Pegasus World Cup 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Social Distancing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Social distancing is a must in the venue. If you are going to watch the race with families or friends, you must know that seating arrangements on-site are designed to observe proper social distancing between audiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you come as a group, you should expect that you will be designated in seating assignments far from each other. No one is exempted from this protocol as it is fairly implemented to all spectators of the event, no matter what ticket you are holding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social distancing is one of the proven ways to decrease the chance of the virus being transmitted from one person to another. If you want to experience the race without worrying about COVID-19, then you must distance yourself from other people watching the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If being in a crowd is unavoidable, making sure that you are 1 meter apart from each other is important. Moreover, never take off your face masks when talking to each other and always be cautious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wear A Face Mask<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from <a href=\"https:\/\/bitrebels.com\/entertainment\/pegasus-world-cup-2021-updates-need-know\/\">reducing their audience attendance<\/a> to 20%, the management has also imposed a strict no face mask, no entry policy. Wearing a face mask is also one of the health protocols executed by the Government according to the order of the World Health Organization to avoid transmission of the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you bring and wear your facemask all the time during the event. Wearing a face shield is a plus but not required to enter the premises. If you need to drink or eat during the event, make sure you put back your face mask right after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have your face mask on, make sure to cover your mouth and nose with your elbows when coughing or sneezing. It is best to start practicing proper etiquette when it comes to these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bring Credit or Debit Card<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tvg.com\/promos\/pegasus-world-cup\/pegasus-cup-betting.html\">place your bets<\/a> on the Pegasus World Cup 2021, you will need your card. Either debit or credit, or even e-wallets, should be brought to the event. The management is introducing cashless wagering to avoid any physical contact during the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banknotes are one of the dirtiest things on earth. You do not know where that money came from. Experts revealed that the new coronavirus could stay and will remain infectious for weeks, and banknotes are so hard to disinfect. Banknotes can&#8217;t be disinfected, and one paper banknote can harbor hundreds of bacteria and viruses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bring Rubbing Alcohol or Hand Sanitizer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleanliness and proper sanitation is a must. When you are out in a public place, you can&#8217;t avoid touching things that have also been touched by others. However, washing your hands every time you touch something seems to be impossible. Thus bringing rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer should help you eliminate any bacteria or viruses on your hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you touch things like door handles or rails, or a seat, you need to immediately sanitize your hands. Cleaning your seat with alcohol and tissue before sitting down can also be good prevention. It may be a bit overboard, but it will save lives, including yours and your family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Should Be Done After The Event<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pegasus World Cup is a huge event that is opting to cut down the audience&#8217;s number next year to ensure health and safety. However, it is still considered a crowded event. Hence, it is expected that all guests and participants will follow the proper health guidelines and observe the safety protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we won\u2019t be able to tell whether we carried the virus or not as it is invisible to the naked eye. You can carry the virus on your way home through your clothes, hair, or shoes, which can infect your whole family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, which is why you need to be extra careful all the time. It is best to disinfect before entering your home. You can also change clothing in the garage, so it\u2019s best to keep a few pieces of clothing there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making sure you are clean, avoid close contact with other family members for 14 days. If you prefer, you can do self-quarantine to make sure you didn\u2019t catch the virus. But if this is undoable, temporary social distancing within the household should be enough. If you manifest symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days, contact your local health unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that your safety is the primary concern of the management and the event organizer. By remembering all the reminders given, you can make sure that you decrease your chance of acquiring the virus and bringing it home with you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image Source Pegasus Cup 2021: Top 5 Reminders For On-site Audiences The Pegasus World Cup series is returning next year.
