This event will happen in the summer for the first time (and for subsequent tournaments) and the era where the tournament was played in January has finally come to an end. Let us take a minute to imagine if the tournament was held this January (especially considering the fact that Liverpool is competing for the Premier League title) and the likes of Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane had to leave to represent their respective countries. The reaction by Jurgen Klopp if that had happened would have been priceless.<\/p>\n<p>This is also the first Africa Cup of Nations tournament in which there would be 24 teams across Africa competing for the trophy as opposed to the previous number of 16. This automatically means that there will be more groups, there will also be best loser selections from four of the groups (just like in the Euros) and there will also be last-16 knock-out games. This obviously lengthens the duration of the tournament and gives more African teams the chance to participate (and probably) win the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Cameroon was scheduled to host the competition but was eventually stripped of hosting rights on the 30<sup>th<\/sup> of November 2018 due to delays in the building and construction of stadia and other infrastructure. There was also a very major concern regarding terrorist attacks from Boko Haram. Morocco was touted as the replacement host but did not show any interest and therefore did not put in a bid. Eventually, on the 8<sup>th<\/sup> of January 2019, CAF (The Confederation of African Football) announced that Egypt would be the host of this year\u2019s tournament. Ironically, in the 2017 tournament (held in Gabon, just in case you have a quiz) it was Cameroon that prevented Egypt from winning the trophy, defeating them 2-1 in the Final.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Qualified Teams.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The group stages and fixtures are yet to be confirmed.
