The\nLeague is the Serie A.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juventus has a monopoly in this League. Since\nthe 2011-2012 season, Juventus has been the winner of the Serie A. That was 9\nseasons ago. Since then, only Napoli have tried to push them to the wire but\nthe Juventus hegemony could not be defeated- credit to Maurizio Sarri for that\npush while with Napoli. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Maurizio Sarri is with Juventus and the\ncompetition has come alive again. This is partly due to him still finding his\nfeet with the Old Lady and the arrival and resurgence of Inter Milan under\nAntonio Conte. All this is good but the emergence of less fancied teams like\nLazio under Simone Inzaghi who are six points behind the joint leaders (and the\nonly team to have beaten Juventus this season), albeit with a game in hand and\nthe form of Ciro Immobile, arguably the most in form striker in Europe (yeah,\nwe know that there is Lewandowski please) is making the League all the more fun\nand unpredictable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a lesser \u2013 competitive &#8211; extent, there are\nalso teams like A.S. Roma and Atalanta managed by Paulo Fonseca and Gian Piero\nGasperini respectively who are very entertaining, score loads of goals and\nultimately have been fairly consistent this season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What more could you ask for in a League that has arguably the best footballer of all time in Ronaldo, the highest goal-scorer in Europe in Ciro Immobile, one of the best Coaches in Europe in Antonio Conte. Oh, and there is now Zlatan Ibrahimovic? \u2013 there are no superlatives for Zlatan. Not a lot more, I presume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NB: New to betting?
