Now, a quality creative player is vital in any team, none more so than the teams hoping to win the European Championships this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having someone who can pick passes and lay the ball on a silver platter for their teammates is vital in a team establishing themselves as one of the favourites in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betfair.com\/sport\/football\/uefa-euro-2020\/11997260\">Euros 2020 odds<\/a>. Here we\u2019ve picked out five of the top assist-makers from the big domestic leagues in Europe over the last season. Read on to find out who the kings of the assists will be for their national teams this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas M\u00fcller (Germany)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Robert Lewandowski may get most of the headlines for Bayern Munich, Thomas M\u00fcller continues to be one of their most important players in terms of providing for his teammates. Last season, M\u00fcller notched an astonishing 21 assists in the Bundesliga, and he\u2019ll be hoping to carry that form into Euro 2020 after being recalled by Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w. M\u00fcller has always been a great servant to the German national team, and it would be no surprise to see him make some major contributions this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steven Berghuis (Netherlands)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020-21 campaign was a sensational one for Netherlands international Steven Berghuis. Alongside the 18 goals he bagged for Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, he also recorded 14 assists, statistics which have seen him linked with a number of clubs throughout Europe. He\u2019ll be hoping to replicate some of that form for the Netherlands this summer, as he attempts to help the national team recover from missing out on two consecutive international tournaments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jadon Sancho (England)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another player who was one of the Bundesliga\u2019s top assist makers last season is England\u2019s Jadon Sancho. The Borussia Dortmund winger has impressed greatly since he arrived in Germany, and England coach Gareth Southgate will be hoping that Sancho can do the business at Euro 2020 and help fire England to a first major international title since the 1966 World Cup. Sancho isn\u2019t a guaranteed starter for the Three Lions, but Southgate will be confident that the 21-year-old can contribute assists for the team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What more can you say about Kevin De Bruyne? He has been one of the defining players of Manchester City\u2019s success in recent years, and there are few better midfielders in world football at the moment. De Bruyne enjoyed another fine season in 2020-21, recording plenty of assists as usual, and he\u2019ll be hoping to turn provider for his Belgium teammates at the Euros this summer. De Bruyne could miss the first match of the tournament after suffering facial injuries in the Champions League final, but when he is fit Belgium will be relying heavily on his contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kingsley Coman (France)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Kingsley Coman isn\u2019t necessarily a guaranteed starter for France at the upcoming Euros, he certainly has the ability to contribute goals and assists when he is called upon. He recorded 12 assists for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season, and with plenty of talent in the French ranks for Euro 2020, coach Didier Deschamps will want everyone chipping in France\u2019s bid to hold both the World Cup and European Championship title at the same time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Football is all about scoring goals, but over the past couple of decades the value of players who can provide assists has risen and risen.
