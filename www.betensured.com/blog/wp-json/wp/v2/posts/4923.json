It is\nnot so long ago that we concluded the previous season, but the 2020\/2021 is\ngearing up to be something special. From the \u2018total\u2019 change in Barcelona-enter\nRonald Koeman- to the Lionel Messi and Barcelona stand-off to the relative\nstability in Real Madrid these days- you can never be too sure when it comes to\nthe Los Blancos to the hire of Andre Pirlo to the massive signings of Chelsea\nand Frank Lampard to the Pierre Emerick Aubameyang contract situation to the\nabsolute meltdown in Valencia (if you do not know, you need to read up on it). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the Jadon Sancho, Dortmund\nand Manchester United situation and the fact that Bayern Munich conquered all\nin Germany and beyond. There is also the Manchester City \u2018comeback\u2019. Will this\nbe Pep Guardiola\u2019s final crack at the Champions League from the blue side of Manchester?\nWill he be able to recover from his poor title defence from last season? Will Liverpool\nand Jurgen Klopp be able to defend their long-awaited comprehensively won Premier\nLeague title, seeing as there has practically been no additional investments to\nthe team? Now, that would be something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;How will the likes of Newcastle and Everton\nfare, seeing as they have invested heavily and wisely (hopefully) during this\ntransfer window? How about Leicester, Wolves, Burnley, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla\n\u2013 Europa League winners, Red Bull Leipzig- without Timo Werner, Arsenal in\nArteta\u2019s full season, Inter Milan- especially considering the fact that it is\nnot entirely certain that Antonio Conte would be the Coach come the beginning\nof the season, Ajax -with the continuous departure of their young talents,\nLyon- last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists, Tottenham and Jose\nMourinho, who would have his first full season and may also not have the luxury\nof purchasing high valued target? The list goes on and on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also Manchester United,\nthe team that finished on a strong note and would look to build on their very\ngood finish to maybe even go as far as winning the League. AC Milan has also been\nmaking stellar recruitments and this Serie A season promises to be one of the\nmost exciting in living memory seeing as the defending Champions have proven\nthat they are not infallible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, there will be a lot\nof football coming to us from this weekend. The wait is almost over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is coming. &nbsp;In no time, we will be able to see our favourite teams take to the pitch again \u2013 so sorry Ligue 1 and UEFA Nations League.
