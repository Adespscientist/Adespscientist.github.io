Neymar Jr, the Brazilian superstar, has joined PokerStars as an ambassador, headlining a new batch of sponsorship deals signed by the gambling giants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neymar was already part of the fold from 2015 to 2017, and has always been a lover of the game of poker. When he\u2019s not on the football pitch, he\u2019s playing cards with his friends, citing his love of the sense of community, the unpredictability of the game, and the chance to win a little bit of money (not that he needs it!).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Love for Poker<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neymar\u2019s love for the football pitch has no equal, but poker comes in as a close second. In fact, the Brazilian uses poker as the ultimate distraction from the game, something he needs to reload his batteries and perform day in, day out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not an exaggeration that PokerStars is a match made in heaven, considering just how much he loves cards. There\u2019s even the famous story of Neymar skipping his team\u2019s celebrations to play online poker instead. Or the time when he was recovering from foot surgery after the match against Marseille in 2018 when he revealed he was playing online poker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/sport\/5788823\/psg-neymar-playing-online-poker-boredom-recovers-foot-surgery\/\">to get over boredom<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons he loves online playing so much is that it gives him a bit of anonymity. Instead of being a face recognized by millions, he\u2019s just one of the many thousands of players. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.casinos.co.za\/\">casinos.co.za<\/a> explains that loading up a random online poker game will match you up with different players from all around the world &#8211; from Africa, Asia to Europe and USA, whether for person-to-person matches or STT and MTT tournaments. And, the possibility to choose your Poker nickname is what can deliver complete privacy when playing online. Something that can&#8217;t be easily accomplished in the land-based casinos. This makes it a great environment for world-known stars such as Neymar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celebrated Career<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neymar is one of the most successful football players today. He\u2019s won several championships with his first club, Santos, another deuce with Barcelona, and three Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint Germain. He\u2019s also won the Champions League with the Catalans, although that prize still eludes him with PSG.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His personal achievements perhaps tower over everything else. Known for his silky skills, he was in the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A Team of the Year several years running. He won the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award in 2011, and the South American Footballer of the Year twice (2011-2012). He\u2019s won top scorer titles, but he\u2019s also an unselfish teammate: in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, he was the Champions League\u2019s top assist provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s something still missing in his trophy cabinet, however: the World Cup. As a proud Brazilian, he\u2019s always dreamed of lifting the FIFA World Cup Trophy. In 2014 he seemed to be well on his way, until a rash challenge from Colombia\u2019s Juan Zuniga cut his quarter final short. Who can forget his tears as he was stretchered off the pitch? Without the mercurial talent, Brazil was destroyed by the Germans in the semifinals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Neymar = Marmite?<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 28-year old Brazilian superstar has a checkered reputation. Many absolutely love him. But a large chunk of football fans despise him. Sometimes it\u2019s a little jealousy, for Neymar has broken the hearts of many opponents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he\u2019s also been accused of being a symbol of what\u2019s wrong with football today. They see his flopping as cheating and his tears as playacting, a talent who is focusing on the wrong things.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s another consideration: according to the CIES Football Observatory, Neymar suffers the most fouls out of any of the five top leagues in Europe. Every twenty minutes, on average, someone will attempt to hack him down. And that\u2019s not even counting the small niggly fouls that the referees don\u2019t even notice. So is it really fair to judge him for reacting to being fouled on a consistent basis?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reunited with Messi?<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neymar\u2019s career may end with an almighty cherry. According to reports, Neymar and Messi may become teammates once again. Neymar certainly yearns for a reunion, having explicitly said so during an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.co.uk\/football\/paris-saint-germain\/story\/4252195\/psgs-neymar-on-lionel-messi-reunion-we-have-to-do-it-next-season\">interview with ESPN<\/a>. And not at Barcelona, the much hyped option last summer, but at PSG.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that Messi wants out. Barcelona also needs the money. There are only a few teams in the world that would be able to afford the Argentinian, with PSG being one of the frontrunners. It\u2019s certainly a salivating prospect, and it would tip the odds in Neymar\u2019s favor when it comes to winning the Champions League.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that Neymar is one of this generation\u2019s finest talents, one of the best we\u2019ve ever seen. For PokerStars, he is a juggernaut signing that will undoubtedly lift the profile of the company. And who knows, maybe he\u2019ll convince Messi to join the fold?&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PokerStars have made a U-turn on their 2017 policy of phasing out their poker athletes, and have now re-signed one of the most popular football players on the planet.
