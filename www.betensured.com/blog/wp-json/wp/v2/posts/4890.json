After almost 12 months, majorly due to the pandemic, we will get to see the curtains close on this big event. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would Robert Lewandowski finally get his hands on the trophy\nand bring to a close to a colossal season for him, or will Neymar finally\nvindicate his move from Barcelona on this very important day? (he definitely\nwas not signed to win the Ligue 1 year in year out).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bayern Munich are obvious favourites as they have scored at\nleast two goals in all their Champions League games, winning all of them in the\nprocess. Lewandowski is obviously the man on fire (he would\/should have easily\nwon the Balon D\u2019or had it been held this year), Serge Gnabry is hot in form, Thomas\nMuller has rekindled his form after falling off last season and is ready for business\nas always. The back-up players in Coutinho, Perisic\/Coman, Tolisso and co. are\nactually very dependable when called upon. They are still a bit suspect at the\nback but when you can outscore almost every opposition in the world, defending\nwould almost be an afterthought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Paris St. Germain, Neymar and co. have a very solid\nchance to write themselves in the history books. They had to do it the hard way\nagainst Atalanta and were better against another German team in RB Leipzig.\nHowever, they should not expect Bayern Munich to be so kind with the chances\nthey were presented. Neymar has been good and \u2018not so good\u2019 at the same time as\nhe has wasted glorious chances. You do not want to do that against the German\njuggernaut. As we all saw against Barcelona, Bayern Munich will make you pay\nonce you do not take your chances. Thiago Silva and co. would need to be\ncareful. Speaking of the captain, this could turn out to be the proper send-off\nfor him as he is not having his contract renewed and this would be his final\ngame. Deep inside, we are all looking forward to a foot race between Alphonso\nDavies and Kylian Mbappe- just once please.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot at stake here: Bayern Munich versus Paris Saint\nGermain; the German Machine versus the oil-money boys; best attack versus best\ndefence; Lewandowski versus Silva, Neymar versus Davies; Mbappe versus Boateng;\ntwo potential treble-winners, one new Champions-League winning Coach, cx. One\nvery defining football game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring it on!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally, the Champions League 2019\/2020 draws to a close tomorrow.
