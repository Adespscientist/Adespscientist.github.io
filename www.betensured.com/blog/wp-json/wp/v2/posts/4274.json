The draw of the tournament is out just a few days back and everything looks well placed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s have a preview of the tournament and of the upcoming matches and try to find out what is in the offering in this year&#8217;s UEFA Champions League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in getting the latest football prediction tips, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\">#1 football prediction site in Nigeria<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are just a few days away from the most exciting and popular European Club football tournament. Champions league matches are going to commence in a couple of days from now and the draws are already out. While some of the groups have good competition, others does not seem to have that much of a competition as such. However, predictions and permutations and combinations are good till the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/unveiling-nigerias-best-football-prediction-site\">match starts<\/a> and it makes up for a good starter. The present level of most of the teams is great and they have the caliber and ability to surprise and change the results. In this article, we are going to have a quick look at the draw and the groups and we are going to analyze and predict the results of the preliminary matches of the Champions League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group A<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Club Brugge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Galatasaray A\u015e<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris Saint-Germain&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real Madrid CF<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group A consists of the above 4 teams. Real Madrid has won\nthe tournament for the maximum time and they seem to be the favorite for\ntopping this group as well. However, there seems to be a close competition for\nthe second spot. All three teams have their fair chances to make it into the\nknockout stage. It would be interesting to see which among the other three\nwould make it in the next round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group B<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FK Crvenazvezda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olympiacos FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tottenham Hotspur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group B consists of above 4 teams. Out of these four\nTottenham Hotspur seems to lead the group. However, there is no guarantee that\nthey are going to top the group. Other teams are equally good and they can\nsurprise each other and therefore it would be hard to determine which among\nthese four teams would make it to the next round. However, Tottenham seems to\nbe favorite for topping this group with other options quite wide open.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group C<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atalanta BC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Shakhtar Donetsk <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GNK Dinamo Zagreb&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manchester City FC<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group C has Manchester City FC and Atlanta BC as quite\nfavorites for topping the group. They are comparatively well placed and stand a\nvery good chance of making it into the knockout stage. It seems that they are\nunlikely to suffer any surprises and should make it comfortably into the last\n16 stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group D<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Lokomotiv Moskva<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juventus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group D consists of above 4 teams. Juventus seems to be favorite\nfor topping the group. Although the other two teams have good chances of\nsurprising each other and they can also give a good run for money to Juventus.\nThis is an interesting group and we have to wait till the end to determine\nwhich two teams make it to the next round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group E<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Salzburg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KRC Genk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool FC&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SSC Napoli<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defending Champions Liverpool are placed in group E.\nThere are some good teams in this group is well but Liverpool and FC Salzburg\nseems to be stronger than the other two teams. However, there are good chances\nthat Nepali and krcgenk can surprise each other and make it into the next\nround.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group F<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borussia Dortmund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Barcelona<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Internazionale Milano<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SK Slavia Praha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group F seems to be most interesting as well as the strongest\nand toughest group. It has Barcelona which is the most popular team of the\ntournament. Apart from it, the group has got AC Milan which is a strong team\nclosely follows by Dortmund and Praha. All these teams have strong players and\nfans support. It would be interesting to see which among these&nbsp; 4 are able\nto make it to the next round As said earlier, this is the toughest group of the\ntournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group G<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC Zenit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olympique Lyonnais&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RB Leipzig&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SL Benfica<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group G consists of the above 4 teams. All of these teams are\nat par with each other and they have chances of making it to the next round.\nThey are good chances of draws as well. Therefore the goal difference can also\nplay a crucial role to determine the final two teams that make it to the round\nof 16. This is an open group and can have any of the two out of the four, who would\nmake it to the next round.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group H<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AFC Ajax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LOSC Lille<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valencia CF<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group H is yet another interesting group with Ajax, Chelsea\nalong with Valencia CF in it. All these teams are more or less at par with each\nother and they could well surprise each other at any time and in any match. So\nwe have to wait till the end to determine which among these four teams finally\nmake it into the next round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final\nwords<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here were some of the predictions at our end. As is clear, these are just predictions and no guarantees. You obviously could have a different opinion and you should also have your own favorite team and players for the tournament.
