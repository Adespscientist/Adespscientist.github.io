In such cases, the team which had scored the higher number of goals away from home was considered the winner of the tie and qualified for the next round of the competition. If the two teams had scored the same number of goals at home and away at the end of normal playing time in the second leg, extra time was played, followed by kicks from the penalty mark if no goal was scored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the decision to remove this rule, ties in which the two teams score the same number of goals over the two legs would be not decided on the number of goals scored away, but two 15-minute periods of extra time are played at the end of the second leg and in case the teams score the same number of goals or no goals during this extra time, kicks from the penalty mark would determine the team which qualifies to the next stage of the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since away goals would no longer be given additional weight to decide a tie, they would also be removed from the criteria used to determine the rankings when two or more teams are equal on points in the group stage, i.e., the criteria applied to matches played by the teams in question. They would not be removed from the additional criteria applied to all group matches if the teams remain equal (higher number of away goals scored in all group matches) to retain a maximum number of sporting criteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Statistics from the mid-1970s until now show a clear trend of continuous reduction in the gap between the number of home\/away wins (from 61%\/19% to 47%\/30%) and the average number of goals per match scored at home\/away (from 2.02\/0.95 to 1.58\/1.15) in men&#8217;s competitions, whereas since 2009\/10, the average goals per game have remained remarkably steady in the UEFA Women&#8217;s Champions League with the overall average of 1.92 for home teams and 1.6 for away teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many different factors may be considered as having an impact on this decline in home advantage. Better pitch quality and standardized pitch sizes, improved stadium infrastructure, higher security conditions, enhanced care of refereeing (and more recently, the introduction of technological support such as GLT and VAR), wider and more sophisticated TV coverage of matches, more comfortable travel conditions, a compressed calendar dictating squad turnover, and changes in competition formats are all elements which have affected the way football is played and blurred the lines between playing at home and away.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has the UEFA President said?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aleksander \u010ceferin added: &#8220;The away goals rule has been an intrinsic part of UEFA competitions since it was introduced in 1965. However, its abolition has been debated at various UEFA meetings over the last few years. Although there was no unanimity of views, many coaches, fans, and other football stakeholders have questioned its fairness and have expressed a preference for the rule to be abolished.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The impact of the rule now runs counter to its original purpose as, in fact, it now dissuades home teams \u2013 especially in first legs \u2013 from attacking because they fear conceding a goal that would give their opponents a crucial advantage. There is also criticism of the unfairness, especially in extra time, of obliging the home team to score twice when the away team has scored.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is fair to say that home advantage is nowadays no longer as significant as it once was, &#8220;the UEFA President concluded. &#8220;Taking into consideration the consistency across Europe in terms of styles of play, and many different factors which have led to a decline in home advantage, the UEFA Executive Committee has taken the correct decision in adopting the view that it is no longer appropriate for an away goal to carry more weight than one scored at home.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the decision has brought about split opinions amongst fans and pundits, it is no surprise seeing a group of people to think the decision is purely political as UEFA has always centered around certain unpalatable decisions to football and killing the excitement the away goal rule brings, especially in the UEFA champions league.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Five famous Champions League away goals win in recent years<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>May 2019: Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (3-3 on aggregate &#8211; Tottenham win on away goals)<br>Tottenham reached their first Champions League final in the most dramatic of circumstances in May 2019. Trailing Ajax 1-0 from the first leg, Mauricio Pochettino&#8217;s side trailed 2-0 at half-time of the return game in Amsterdam and looked all certain to be knocked out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step forward Lucas Moura, who scored two goals in four second-half minutes to bring Spurs level on the night, before firing home a 96th-minute winner to complete his hat-trick and send them through to the final.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>April 2019: Man City 4-3 Tottenham (4-4 on aggregate &#8211; Tottenham win on away goals)<br>With Tottenham protecting a 1-0 lead from their quarter-final first leg against Manchester City, the two sides shared five goals inside a chaotic opening 21 minutes of the second leg. Sergio Aguero made it 4-2 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate in the second half to put Pep Guardiola&#8217;s side on course for the last four, before Fernando Llorente&#8217;s header edged Spurs ahead on away goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the drama, Raheem Sterling saw his stoppage-time strike ruled out by VAR, leaving Guardiola on his knees in despair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>March 2019: Paris Saint-Germain 1-3 Man Utd (3-3 on aggregate &#8211; Man Utd win on away goals)<br>Manchester United became the first team in Champions League\/European Cup history to overcome a 2-0 or greater home first-leg deficit when they stunned Paris Saint-Germain in March 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus Rashford was the hero with a nerveless 94th-minute penalty to level the tie at 3-3 on aggregate and send the Red Devils through on away goals, arguably securing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the manager&#8217;s job on a permanent basis in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>April 2018: Roma 3-0 Barcelona (Aggregate 4-4 &#8211; Roma win on away goals)<br>Another thrilling second-leg comeback, this time from Roma, as they overturned a 4-1 first-leg deficit to progress past Barcelona and go through to the semi-finals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defender Kostas Manolas scored the crucial third goal, heading in at the near post with eight minutes remaining to spark scenes of delirium inside the Stadio Olimpico.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>May 2009: Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (1-1 on aggregate &#8211; Barcelona win on away goals)<br>A stoppage-time strike from Andres Iniesta canceled out Michael Essien&#8217;s early goal and edged Barcelona past Chelsea and through to the final on away goals back in 2009, sparking scenes of chaos inside Stamford Bridge at full time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all too much for a furious Didier Drogba who, frustrated from numerous refereeing decisions, launched a verbal tirade to referee Tom Ovrebo after the final whistle before swearing directly down a TV camera as he made his way off the pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, as much as UEFA might be right about home teams taking advantage of the away goal rule, I think the flare, despair, joy, energy, and goosebumps developed because of the away goal rule is the reason why the majority of the fans love the beautiful game of football. The scraping of the away goal rule now, I think, brings a balance to the game without any advantage for either the home or away team.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EDITORIAL kaka@betensured.com The away goals rule in all European club competitions has been abolished, UEFA has confirmed.
