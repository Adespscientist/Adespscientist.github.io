Bad news for the Celtics Fans"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Massachusetts has been on track to legalize sports betting for a while now. However, because sports legislation in the state is still dragging its feet, online sports betting is still a dream, rather than a reality. While legislators continue to dilly dally, other states continue to forge on, reaping the benefits of online sports betting, especially during these grim times we find ourselves living in now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, New Jersey which is now the undisputed king of legalized sports betting in America <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/casinos-investors-place-bigger-bets-on-gamblers-playing-from-home-11597597200\">has been skyrocketing<\/a> despite the gut-wrenching absence of live sports. People staying at home are not only betting on sports or games in far-flung continents as the case may be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a growing array of entertainment to bet on in mobile internet-casino-based-games which feature real stakes and live dealers known as iGaming. In the U.S., legalized iGaming is only effective in four markets so far: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. It\u2019s also legal in Michigan and West Virginia, but not yet active. The State of Illinois also <a href=\"https:\/\/coolthingschicago.com\/illinois-online-sports-betting\/\">recently legalized sports betting<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the digitalization of wagering as we know it is still in its infancy, it is expected to grow considerably in the coming years. Add to this the increasing broadband availability, our growing data capacity, the large range of secure payment solutions available, and superior gaming experience, as well as government regulations that are finally relaxing, and what we have here folks is a recipe for success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Massachusetts wants to tap into this new and remarkable source of desperately needed tax revenue, it will do well to advance the cause of legalizing online gambling in the state. Plus, legalized sports betting is going to be a thing everywhere by 2030 and Massachusetts should want to get in on the show sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Failure to legalize sports betting is bad news<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2020, the pandemic hit the U.S, much like it has many other parts of the world, thereby imposing stay at home orders and business closures all over the country. All but 2 of the country\u2019s 1000 casinos were impacted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that same month, the Garden State, trailed by others including Delaware, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, the only 4 states to legalize online poker sites, all reported sky-high gaming revenues. Nevada, America\u2019s gambling mecca, recorded a more than 90% boost in revenues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before the pandemic swept through America, the online gambling industry had been on a steady advancement course. In 2017, when the industry was still in its infancy, the international market was valued at approximately $45.8 billion. Experts predict that in the future, global online gambling bets will have skyrocketed to almost $95 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the global market for online gambling estimated to grow by 11.5% annually until 2027, failing to<a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2018\/05\/14\/politics\/sports-betting-ncaa-supreme-court\/index.html\"> legalize sports betting<\/a> in Massachusetts is simply just a bad idea. There is a huge shift that is taking place in the industry and states that want to take advantage of the wave must step on board now, otherwise they\u2019ll have to play catch up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the legislators legalize sports betting in Massachusetts, the fledgling sports betting industry would grow exponentially to generate billions of dollars in bets each year, hundreds of millions in operator revenue, as well as tens of millions in tax revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why should Massachusetts legalize sports betting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Massachusetts already enjoys a considerable base of existing land based casinos and one of the most vibrant metropolitan markets yet. All it needs is a regulatory framework that\u2019s designed to land attractive operators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher state budget shortages are serving as a great motivator for faster regulatory approval of legalized sports betting alongside mobile casino gaming. Massachusetts state budget wasn&#8217;t exactly in the best place before the pandemic. However, in the following months, state budgets everywhere have been devastated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With shuttered local businesses and tens of thousands left without employment, the state revenue is at risk of collapsing while costs keep skyrocketing. If it\u2019s left unchecked, the fiscal hole in the state budget will continue to be felt long after the pandemic is over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s unsustainable. Massachusetts lawmakers must now seriously look into legalizing sports betting as a way of raising the state\u2019s revenue. Plus, sports betting operations are easy and quick to launch and can be done in under six months. Even without the presence of live sports, sports betting companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel have still found events for customers to wager on from Korean baseball to reality show outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18 states including Washington D.C have already taken steps to legalize sports betting. An additional 4 have passed the legislation but are yet to be active. The tax rates in each of these states vary broadly but most fall between 10% and 20% of revenue. In total, sports betting will generate a diffident $1 billion in taxable gross gaming revenue just this year alone.,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the vast majority of this gross number will come from the 4 biggest sports betting markets namely New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. However, there is still a lot of money to be made and Massachusetts is so far missing out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several states have active sports betting bills in the works, which is further proof of the wealth to be made once states legalize sports betting. In particular, Ohio, Georgia, and Louisiana, for example, could all potentially legalize sports betting this year. In California, lawmakers have already attempted to get sports betting legislation implemented. However, this move was thwarted by tribal casino operators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final Thoughts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although states like California and Massachusetts have suffered setbacks, it\u2019s definitely not the end of the road. By 2025, it is anticipated that the U.S. sports betting market could have grown to reach the $8 billion mark, maybe even grow as high as $10 billion, as more and more states continue to embrace the benefits of legalizing sports betting. If Massachusetts wants a slice of this pie, it must not delay the process again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that with support from Governor Baker and the right authorities, as well as the heavy lobbying to be done by DraftKings and other Massachusetts-based betting companies, it is only a matter of time before sports betting comes to the state.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Massachusetts has been on track to legalize sports betting for a while now.
