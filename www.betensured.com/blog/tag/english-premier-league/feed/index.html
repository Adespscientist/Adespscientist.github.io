<ul><li><strong>Everton form: LWDDW</strong></li><li><strong>Crystal Palace form: DDDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>Everton now look like a cohesive unit under Carlo Ancelotti, and this was shown in the 3-2 comeback win against Watford. Since his appointment, they have picked up 15-points in 8 matches, leaving them 4-points behind 5<sup>th</sup> placed Tottenham. Carlito has turned Goodison Park into a fortress, where they are unbeaten in the last 5 matches and conceded only 3-goals. This is particularly evidenced by Mason Holgate who has transformed into a gallant composed Center-Back. Toffees should handle Roy Hodgson’s side who can’t find goals. </p>



<p>The Eagles on the other hand are experiencing a downturn in form, as  defeat to Sheffield meant 6 PL matches without a victory. The great start to the season leaves them in a healthy position so no cause for concern. However they need to start scoring goals, which means relying on Ivorian Wilfried Zaha. Expect a win for Everton with few goals.</p>



<h2>Brighton vs Watford</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Brighton form: DLDLD</strong></li><li><strong>Watford form: WWDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>The Seagulls continue to play some nice football but they exemplify the saying ‘good for nothing.’ They have just (1) win in the last 10 PL matches. With all their football, they are 15<sup>th</sup> position in the table, just 2-points off relegation. After missing a good opportunity to beat an abysmal West Ham, they face a tougher opponent in Watford, who pose a different challenge. The Hornets will not make this an easy contest.</p>



<p>Watford suffered their first back-to-back defeat under Nigel Pearson and they are looking to get back to winning ways to jump out of relegation zone. They make it difficult to score them when playing Away and utilising Delofeu on the counter has helped free up space- but it is clear they have struggled without Senegal international Ismaila Sarr. This should be an even game, but Watford will try to knick a scrappy win.</p>



<h2>Sheffield Utd vs Bournemouth</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Sheffield Un</strong>i<strong>t</strong>e<strong>d form: LWDLW</strong></li><li><strong>Bournemouth&#8217;s form: LLLWW</strong></li></ul>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side earned a massive 3-points against Crystal Palace to move ahead of Man Utd- they are 5-points off top 4 and a win will send them to 5<sup>th</sup> position for a week. Their manager’s remarkable tactical knowledge has seen the pre-season relegation favourites now fighting for Europe. The Blades should secure a win against Bournemouth </p>



<p>Bournemouth meanwhile are still in trouble despite their back-to-back victories. Their Away form is a joke- they have lost 4 out of last 5 matches and scored just (1) goal. Last season’s wonder Ryan Fraser is without a goal involvement in the last 14 matches and that sums up the teams’ form. This plays into Sheffield Utd’s hands nicely, as their defence need not worry too much about the attacking threat. </p>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side will continue their defensive football, with new signing Sander Berge adding dynamism and a robust edge to their midfield. &nbsp;They should see out a win, but expect few goals in this match.</p>



<h2>Man City vs West Ham</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Man City form: WWDWL</strong></li><li><strong>West Ham form: LDLLD</strong></li></ul>



<p>Defending champions Man City were dealt a heavy blow in the 2-0 loss to Tottenham that put them out of the title race. But they have 2<sup>nd</sup> place to fight for with Leicester. They also have other cup competitions coming up, especially the Champions League. Still, West Ham should be an easy tie for Guardiola’s men if the manager can listen to his players and stop rotating the team. The Sky Blues simply need to plug the hole in the defence. So with Laporte returning for this tie, there might be a cleansheet here.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sterling is out with a hamstring injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11927880/raheem-sterling-ruled-out-of-manchester-city-vs-west-ham-with-hamstring-injury" target="_blank">Sterling is out with a hamstring injury</a>, which means Aguero and Mahrez are the ones to watch. Europe’s best attack have scored an average of 2-goals in the last 5 matches at Home and have won 3 of those games.</p>



<p>The Hammers are back to square one after the 4-0 win against Bournemouth renewed hope. But what did they really expect from out of touch Moyes? The meltdown against Brighton extended their winless run to 5 PL games and now they are 18<sup>th</sup>. The Hammers have lost 4 out of the last 5 Away, conceding 9-goals.</p>



<p>Man City will set up as usual, operation attack, while West Ham are expected to park the bus. The reverse fixture saw a 5-0 demolition, so expect goals in this one, especially in the Second Half. It should be a comfortable evening for the Citizens.</p>

<p>After a spirited performance against Leicester that saw them knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties, the Toffees will be looking to repeat those efforts when Arsenal come to Goodison Park. Ferguson will continue his tactics of dogged defending and counters, which will make Arsenal attackers work hard for goals. Top boy Richarlison could cause problems for the Gunners. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Arsenal are recovering from a Kevin De Bruyne masterclass that proved why they shouldn&#8217;t be in the top-6. Their fans will be happy this is Ljungberg&#8217;s final game as caretaker- he looks as clueless as Steve Kean at Blackburn. He will be looking to Martinelli&#8217;s energy, and Aubameyang to help him finish on a high. Despite their poor form, the Gunners know how to handle Everton, with 4 wins in the last 5 meetings.</p>



<p>Both clubs cannot keep a cleansheet so there should be goals in this one- Everton players will be tired from the midweeek action. Arsenal on the other hand just can&#8217;t defend. So the game will be a matter of who can cut out unforced errors.</p>



<h2>Aston Villa vs Southampton</h2>



<p>Villans showed no mercy in the 5-0 demolition of Liverpool&#8217;s kids on Tuesday. They will carry the momentum when playing a Southampton side that really should be in the Championship. With their incredible home form and return of Jack Grealish to the starting line-up, they should put in a confident performance this Saturday.</p>



<p>Southampton can&#8217;t seem to catch a break anywhere. To add to their Away woes, last week they lost 1-0 to West Ham at Home- which sapped their morale. However, they have Danny Ings to call upon in times like these. He has an incredible 9 goals already and can score against a substandard Villa defence. Expect a proper relegation fight.</p>



<h2>Bournemouth vs Burnley </h2>



<p>Bournemouth shocked everyone with a win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge despite their injury crisis. They are without a recognised back four, Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson and Josh King are also doubts. So they might struggle in front of goal against Burnley.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the Clarets rarely score goals, as they are so focused on defending. Meaning this match should have few goals in it. Burnley might edge the game out simply because they have a fit squad, not because they are better. This will be a scrappy contest. </p>



<h2>Brighton vs Sheffield United</h2>



<p>Brighton is a team that doesn&#8217;t make too much noise. They play good football, and have taken big scalps such as Tottenham, this season. The only thing left is to be pragmatic- and that is exactly what they need to be against Sheffield Utd to earn 3 points. Neil Maupay and co have the tools to break down a dogged Sheffield Utd&#8217;s defence. </p>



<p>The Blades on the other hand are the most defensive newly-promoted side ever. No one has figured our Chris Wilder&#8217;s tactics of overlapping center-backs and shifting formations. Hence why they haven&#8217;t conceded more than 1 goal Away in the past 5 games. Lundstrum and Fleck are in fine form and can come up with goals when Mousset can&#8217;t. This should be an even contest.</p>



<h2>Newcastle vs Crystal Palace</h2>



<p>Newcastle are unbeaten in the last 7 Home games, so will go into this game confident of avoiding defeat. However, without maverick Allan Saint-Maximin (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who tried to rainbow flick a 6 ft 4 player (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.planetfootball.com/trending/allan-saint-maximin-tried-to-rainbow-flick-a-6ft-4in-defender-were-all-for-it/" target="_blank">who tried to rainbow flick a 6ft 4 Sebastian Haller</a>) they must rely on Almiron, Shelvey, and Joelinton. Crystal Palace have a simple strategy of collecting 3-points here and there to avoid relegation- park the bus. Zaha and co can cause problems for Newcastle, but there will be few goals.</p>



<h2>Norwich vs Wolves </h2>



<p>In 19th position, Norwich will most likely be relegated. They have shipped in 14 goals in the last 5 Home games. Their bravery in attack is a breath of fresh air, but they remind everyone of Blackpool in the 2010-11 season. Wolves on the other hand are hurt by a 2-1 defeat to Tottenham, and will unleash their anger on Norwich. It should be an easy win for Wolves who have too much in their arsenal to hurt Norwich up-front, and avoid conceding chances at the back.</p>



<h2>Manchester City vs Leicester</h2>

<p>The champions have largely disappointed this season- owing to injuries and defensive vulnerabilities. They have lost 3 games at Home, the most in Guardiola&#8217;s career.  So the news that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Aguero and Stones have returned to training (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2019/december/man-city-team-news-leicester-pep-guardiola-interview" target="_blank">Aguero and Stones have returned to training</a> couldn&#8217;t come at a better time for the Citizens. They need to win to close the gap with 2nd-place Leicester. De Bruyne and Sterling will have to step up to down the Foxes- they are the ones to watch for City.</p>



<p>Leicester, like City are celebrating progress to the Semis of Carabao Cup, as they chase silverware this season. However, after an unwise decision to play their strongest side in midweek, it will be interesting to see how they fare against the Sky Blues.</p>



<p>The same cannot be said for City whose squad is so deep, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/9699559/mourinho-man-city-b-win-premier-league-man-utd-sky-sports-chelsea/" target="_blank">Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders</a>. Yes Leicester will rely on Vardy, but the truth is the midfield core (Maddison, Tielemans and Ndidi) need to put in a season defining performance for the Foxes to take any point.</p>



<p>City do score a lot of goals and trust Guardiola to stick with his system of trying to overload the Foxes with wave after wave of attacks. However, this is one of Man City&#8217;s toughest fixtures. Last seasons game proves it. Club legend Kompany had to produce a strike from the gods to beat Leicester and secure the title. So this game should be a cracker for the neutrals.</p>

<ul><li> The Special One welcomes the club he once loved wearing the badge of bitter rivals Spurs</li><li>Chelsea face another big-six rival after a horrible run of form, wishing Hazard was here to save them</li></ul>



<p>Not to be superstitious or anything but since Jose Mourinho was unveiled as Tottenham&#8217;s manager, Chelsea&#8217;s form took a dramatic nosedive. The Blues have won an abysmal 2 in 7 games, and they were fragile 2-1 wins.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in North London, a refreshed Mourinho has settled in well, cooling the Spurs seat, and steering his team from 14th position in the league to 3-points away from the final UEFA Champions League spot (Chelsea is 4th). The Special One goes up against Lampard for the second time. The two enjoyed success in the early 2000s, forming a core part of Chelsea&#8217;s golden years, but on Sunday they go head to head as bitter London rivals.</p>



<p>Tottenham welcome Chelsea to their glamorous stadium for the first time on Sunday 22nd December 2019 in the mouth-watering clash of the weekend. This is a fixture that rarely ends as a draw as both tend to go all or nothing. So who will give their fans an early Christmas present?</p>



<h2>Mourinho Looking to School Lampard</h2>

</div></div>



<p>Tottenham form: <strong>WWLWW</strong> </p>



<p>Spurs impressed last time out, beating Wolves in a hard-fought battle at the Molineux, taking a huge stride towards top-4. Right now they look like the only team ready to secure the final Champions League spot. They are unbeaten at Home in the last 5 games, have a fantastic manager, a great squad, and the players are beaming with joy.</p>



<p>Earlier this season, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Portuguese warned that the Blues will miss out on the top-4 because they lack the pragmatism to control big games (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7671113/Mourinho-claims-Chelsea-not-make-two-doubts-ability-handle-big-sides.html" target="_blank">the Portuguese warned that the Blues will miss out on the top-4 because they lack the pragmatism to control big games</a>. A lesson that should&#8217;ve been taken seriously. The Blues have lost all games against the big boys this season. So does Mourinho have a point? This young Chelsea side are naive thinking they can match rivals toe to toe- and he will try to teach his counterpart this lesson on Sunday.</p>



<p>Spurs players have quickly grasped their manager&#8217;s demands. The counter-attacking 4-2-3-1 system makes the most sense with the players on ground. So their raw pace and technique should expose Chelsea&#8217;s weaknesses on the counter. Indeed Tottenham will fashion a few clear-cut chances.</p>



<p>Although this is a rivalry, Spurs have the key to unlock Chelsea&#8217;s defence- we can expect a lot of goals in this one.  The devastation the quartet can cause on a very good day was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mentioned before (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/big-match-preview-man-utd-vs-tottenham-gw15/?preview_id=4392&amp;preview_nonce=bb3aef3f57&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=4419" target="_blank">mentioned before</a>, therefore they will be licking their lips when facing a porous Chelsea defence. Heung-Min Son put in a world-class performance last time in this fixture, so he is the one to watch out for. It would be interesting to see him go up against Azpilicueta.</p>



<h2>Young Blues Need New Ideas to Arrest Poor Form</h2>



<p>Chelsea form: <strong>LLWLL</strong></p>



<p>Chelsea fans were confused after witnessing a heart-breaking 4-0 defeat to Man Utd in Lampard&#8217;s first game as manager. The young Blues outplayed their opponents for 90 mins, but four simple counter-attacking moves rendered the performance useless. Little did they know, this was a sign of things to come- Lampard&#8217;s Chelsea cannot beat big teams. So it&#8217;s cringe that assistant manager <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jody Morris sees the funny side (opens in a new tab)" href="https://talksport.com/football/634517/jose-mourinho-chelsea-record-big-six-frank-lampard-man-city/" target="_blank">Jody Morris sees the funny side</a> of this.</p>



<p>Too many people have rightly complained about Chelsea&#8217;s defence and goalkeeper. They have kept 1 clean-sheet in the last 10 games. With most goals coming in the second-half when concentration levels drop. So expect them to concede again. </p>



<p>In the past five games, teams have figured out how to deal with Chelsea- just defend deep, limit their attackers spaces, and close down Jorginho. This led to Tammy Abraham struggling to score when facing gallant defenders. Now the Pensioners are starting to miss Eden Hazard&#8217;s magic- in times like these, he would just pick up the ball and do something crazy that leads to a goal. Lampard is expecting Pulisic to do the same, but how?</p>



<p>The Blues manager has only one style of play, relying on high pressing, quick direct passing, and keeping possession. When it works Chelsea look like world-beaters, but when it doesn&#8217;t they look like Norwich. We&#8217;ll have to see which Chelsea turns up on Sunday- indeed they have players that can cause problems for Spurs. So this should be a very good game.</p>



<h2>Team News and Likely Line-ups</h2>



<p>For Tottenham, Tanguy Ndombele is sidelined with a groin injury. Ben Davies, Lamela, and Lloris are all ruled out. Harry Winks is back from injury but might be on the bench for this one, with Eric Dier set to keep his place. Mourinho will stick with his trusted 4-2-3-1 formation, with the aim of hitting Chelsea on the counter. It is likely they will defend deep, and afford little spaces for the Blues attackers. He will probably name an unchanged line-up from last time.</p>

<p>Chelsea have a relatively fit squad. Loftus-Cheek was seen back in training, doing some light ball work. Although Tomori is back, he will not be fit in time, and Giroud has a slight ankle injury. If a pragmatic Chelsea turns up they would ditch the usual 4-5-1 formation and adopt a 3-4-3 to avoid counter-attacks and give the defence a stronger shield. This will also allow the wing-backs to be more involved in the game when the attackers can&#8217;t get space. This is the expected line-up.</p>
