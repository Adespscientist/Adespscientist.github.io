West Ham were fined \u00a35.5m for breaching the regulations but escaped a points deduction and retained their Premier League status on the final day of the season.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the Premier League takes far more notice &#8211; and clubs are acutely aware of their obligations.<\/p>\n<p>However, the complex nature of contracts mean changing a player&#8217;s status takes time &#8211; and a lot of legal advice. That is where Ederson and Manchester City are.<\/p>\n<p>So, while a fee is agreed and salary confirmed, this transfer will not be concluded until everyone &#8211; including the Premier League &#8211; is satisfied.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">&#8216;There&#8217;s a bit of Manuel Neuer in him&#8217;<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__body media\">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__image gel-responsive-image\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes sp-lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 976w\" alt=\"Ederson Moraes\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/AF9C\/production\/_96265944_gettyimaged.jpg 976w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">Ederson Moraes made seven Champions League appearances this season<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><i>South American football expert Tim Vickery on BBC Radio 5 live:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Ederson is a very different kind of keeper to Claudio Bravo in that he is bigger, much more physically imposing, and much younger.<\/p>\n<p>He has ability with his feet and has a howitzer of a big kick, which paradoxically could help City play out from defence by forcing the opposing press back a bit. He looks confident on the ball, but how he copes with that style will be very important to how he does at the club.<\/p>\n<p>There seems to be a bit of the Manuel Neuer in him. He&#8217;s big and commanding; there&#8217;s that chest of steel when he comes off his line very quickly. He looks a very promising goalkeeper indeed, but I&#8217;m not sure what his English is like, so communication could be a problem.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">Would this be a world-record fee for a goalkeeper?<\/h3>\n<p>Gianluigi Buffon&#8217;s world-record move for a goalkeeper from Parma to Juventus in 2001 was reported to be worth 53m euros, or \u00a332.6m at the time.<\/p>\n<p>But at current exchange rates, Ederson&#8217;s 40m euros transfer is equivalent to \u00a335m.
