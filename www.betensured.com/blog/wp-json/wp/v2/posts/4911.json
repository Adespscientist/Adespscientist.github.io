To others, it was a\nchance to win a trophy, small as it may be. One\u2019s perspective would ultimately\nbe dependent on the team you support, and the outcome of the game of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preview involved the absence of Alexander Lacazette and Trent\nAlexander Arnold (due to injury) and questioning whether Nico Williams would be\nable to handle the in-form Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. There was also the\nquestion of whether Aubameyang would celebrate (if\/when he scored) by wearing\nthe Black Panther mask and doing the salute as he has done so before, seeing\nthat the actor -Chadwick Boseman- lost his battle with colon cancer yesterday.\nMay his soul rest in peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game started well for the Reds as Liverpool dominated\npossession. Arsenal broke well early on and Saka sent a cross-field ball to\nAubameyang and he took advantage of the inexperience of Williams and curled one\ninto the bottom corner from outside the box. He eventually did the Wakanda salute\n\u2013 without the mask, unfortunately. Eddy Nketiah also had a chance to double Arsenal\u2019s\nlead but had his weak shot saved by Alisson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool took the initiative and were bossing possession.\nSadio Mane had a number of chances after being one-on-one with the goal-keeper\nbut Martinez was equal to the task. Naby Keita and Takushi Minamino came on for\nLiverpool and were very useful, with Minamino getting the leveller late on.\nArsenal began to play better while the Liverpool squad looked a bit leggy late\non.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game went to a shoot-out with Liverpool\u2019s Ryan Brewster\nthe only player missing his penalty. Arsenal won and they get their first silverware\nof the season? Or did they? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the Community Shield is not\nrecognized as a competitive game and is more or less a \u2018curtain raiser\u2019 for the\nPremier League 2020\/2021 season scheduled to kick-off on the 12<sup>th<\/sup> of\nSeptember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Arsenal, it is a positive one for Arteta and his team as\nthey managed to go toe-to-toe with the current Premier League holders. The concern\/issue\nis in midfield and attack as the absence of Dani Ceballos was sorely missed and\nwhile Mohammed Elneny held his own but may not be an ideal solution in the long\nterm for this Arsenal side while Eddie Nketiah does not seem like the future\n(unfortunately). There are games where Arsenal would need to dominate games for\nlong periods and Arsenal would need midfielders who can control games and make\nkey passes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Liverpool, as said earlier, this was just a pre-season\ngame. Most times, the Community Shield winners do not go on to win the Premier\nLeague, which is a good sign. The absence of Alexander-Arnold was obvious, as shown\nin the first goal. Jordan Henderson was also not available. Although this\ncurrent break is a short one for them \u2013 as applied to every other team- there\nstill needs to be great improvement before the season starts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To some, it was just a pre-season game.
