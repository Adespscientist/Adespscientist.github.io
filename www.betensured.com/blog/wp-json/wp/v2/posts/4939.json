Winning\nthe Champions League in the 2018\/2019 season, winning the English Premier\nLeague in style last season and being one of the most formidable European sides.\nThe last time Merseyside looked this good was when David Moyes and Rafa Benitez\nwere in charge of Everton and Liverpool respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the blue corner- Everton that\nis- things are really looking up. The signing of veteran Manager Carlo\nAncelotti during the previous season seems to have opened a lot of doors. The\nsignings of James Rodriguez and Allan from Real Madrid and Napoli respectively\nthis season would never have materialized if Ancelotti was not in charge. The two\naforementioned signings plus the signing of Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford\nlooks like a master stroke as the Everton midfield has been \u2018transformed overnight\u2019\nand can go toe to toe with any midfield in the Premier League as evidenced in\nthe game against Tottenham, a game that they won by a solitary goal. It could\nhave easily been more save for some very bad finishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlo Ancelotti brings with him\na vast array of experience from a host of top clubs in Europe, a feature that\nnot a lot of football clubs can boast of. At 61, he is not necessarily close to\nthe end of his career (just look at Roy Hodgson) and making Everton one of the\nbig boys again and bringing back the glory days of old would be a very good\nachievement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that to happen, a couple of\nthings would need to be in place. The defense would have to be solid. Can the\nlikes of Yerry Mina and Michael Keane be dependable week in, week out? In\nmidfield, can James Rodriguez be consistent enough -fitness wise- and be that\nmidfield maestro and get back to his best? Can the likes of Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin\nbe dependable enough to get the goals when called upon? Can the likes of\nWalcott, Bernard, Tosun and Iwobi be also useful additions when they are needed\non the pitch?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key thing about the Everton\nsquad is the fact that the side does not have depth. An injury to a key player\ncould be catastrophic. Player\u2019s fitness would be top priority and that may be a\nvery difficult task now that there a lot of games to be played in a short period\nin order to meet up with the schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a very good vibe\naround Merseyside that things are looking up on the blue side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Carlo Ancelotti on board,\nthe fans have every reason to.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is a good time to be in Merseyside.
