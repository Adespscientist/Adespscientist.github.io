The word bet according to googling the word &#8216;bet&#8217; on google means<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>To&nbsp;risk a sum of money or valued item against someone else&#8217;s on the basis of the outcome of an unpredictable event such as a race or game<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It says &#8220;<em>Unpredictable event such as a race or game<\/em>&#8221; but is football actually unpredictable?? <!--more-->If Chelsea was topping the table and they had a game against Aston Villa in Chelsea&#8217;s home for instance, and Chelsea has always &nbsp;drawn every match played against Aston Villa in their home, who do you think would win the match?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/how-much-money-does-the-indian-premier-league-make\/\">Check here to see how much the Indian Premier league is making annually<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It would be foolhardy to place a bet for Chelsea to win just because they are topping the table. In this case the safest and best thing any professional bettor would do is to place a bet of Home Win Or Draw H(W\/d) not an outright Home win. This type of analysis and intelligent prediction shows that betting on football games differs from betting on casino where you just dash free money to the bookmakers. Football outcomes are 80% predictable.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.betensured.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click HERE to use Our Prediction Site<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>The second part of the word <em>betensured<\/em> is the word &#8220;ensure&#8221;.
