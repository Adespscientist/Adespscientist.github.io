While you are scratching your head trying to answer that question, just know that things are not going to get easier for Mikel Arteta. Red results in the Premier League, all green in the Europa League. Against Burnley, they had more chances to score compared to previous encounters. This may or may not have been a result of fans being in the stadium &#8211; after so many months out \u2013 spurring them on. Ultimately, it resulted to nothing and to worsen things, their most reliant goal-scorer scored in the wrong post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Burnley, they can take some encouragement from this as they have been poor themselves so far. Keeping a clean sheet away against a team that you have not beaten in their backyard for a long time is a real plus for Sean Dyche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Arsenal, the inquisition continues. Everything seems to be falling apart. According to Squwaka, even bottom placed Sheffield United have created more chances than Arsenal. The omission of Mesut Ozil keeps raising more questions with each matchday. Arteta most likely does not have long now. The tide has to turn now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Real Madrid control the Madrid derby.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;From almost being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on the last matchday for the first time in their history to eventually clinching top spot to stopping Atletico\u2019s 26-game unbeaten La Liga run with relative ease, Real Madrid seemed to have turned a corner very nicely. They have started keeping clean sheets as well and the return of Sergio Ramos, their captain, from injury is not a mere coincidence as they seem more solid at the back. Now, they have to kick on and get into a nice run of games to put pressure on those above in the La Liga table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Boring Manchester derby..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing to see here. Just two teams trying as hard as possible not to lose, ultimately creating a boring spectacle for fans and neutrals alike. Well done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>AC Milan maintain unbeaten run..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AC Milan have shown time and time again during this season that they are the real deal, hence their unbeaten run. The recent absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic has seen them struggle a bit and that came to light again this weekend when they were two goals down at home. Thanks to Theo Hernandez, one of the other standout players for Milan, they were still able to salvage a point. Their rivals Inter Milan are just three points behind so they would have to continue this streak to be able to maintain their peak position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Lucien Favre sacked by Borussia Dortmund.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dortmund has arguably the best assembly of young talents in the world but since the injury to Erling Haaland, they have been blowing hot and cold and the result over the weekend was more or less the final nail in Lucien Favre\u2019s \u2018coffin\u2019. Losing by 5 goals at home to Stuttgart is a very shameful score-line and this left an ambitious club like Dortmund with no choice. It would be interesting to see who fills the dug out in the Signal Idunal Park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Ligue 1 is hotting up..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris Saint Germain hosted Lyon this weekend and it was billed to be an entertaining game. What few people expected was for PSG to not score a goal at home especially after their last home game in the Champions League. Losing to Monaco some days ago after going two goals up and then losing in this fashion against Lyon is a real concern for Thomas Tuchel and his men. They have already lost four times in 14 games this season and if this continues, this may not be PSG\u2019s season. They currently sit third with just the one point behind the league leaders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the neutrals, this makes the Ligue 1 a lot more interesting. Right now, it is one of the more interesting leagues to watch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Arsenal\u2019s multi-coloured form continues.. Is Arsenal currently in a crisis?
