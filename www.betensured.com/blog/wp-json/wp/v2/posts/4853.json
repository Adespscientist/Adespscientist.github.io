Credit\nto the Health Services in England and across the world for their bravery and\ncommitment. Also, Rest in Peace to those who have lost loved ones during this\nperiod.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pandemic saw players that were injured make a comeback\nbefore the season ended. A comeback that would most likely not have materialized\nhad there not been a mandatory break due to the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goalkeeper: Alisson Becker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He ultimately did not win the award for most clean sheets but\nfor him to come close even after featuring in just 29 games, putting his clean\nsheet percentage at over 50%, the best in the League is no mean feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Right Back: Trent Alexander-Arnold.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold had 13 assists, the most for any\ndefender in the League and was also influential to his team winning the Premier\nLeague. His defending still needs to be tuned up but when you can be involved\nin 17 goal contributions as a defender, your sins would most times be forgiven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Centre Back: Virgil Van Dijk.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Dijk is arguably the best centre back in the world. He\nlooked like the missing piece in Liverpool\u2019s defence. He showed it again this\nseason, making Liverpool have one of the meanest defenses in the League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Centre Back: Caglar Soyuncu.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asides his poor performance and horrible behaviour against\nBournemouth, Soyuncu has been a very capable replacement for \u00a380m Harry\nMaguire. The fact that he slotted seamlessly into this expansive Leicester side\nwith little or no hiccups especially in the earlier part of the season was\nquite extraordinary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Left Back: Andy Robertson.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solid at the back, solid going forward, the left back barely\nputs a foot wrong and covers practically every blade of grass (on the left hand\nside, not the whole pitch please) any time he steps onto the field of play. His\n14 goal contributions are testament to his ability and performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Central Midfield: Jordan Henderson.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jordan Henderson has shown himself to be a true warrior and\nleader for this Liverpool side. He has really come into his own and is one of\nthe most dependable players in every game for Liverpool. He also pops up with\none or two goals whenever he is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Central Midfield: Kevin de Bruyne.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the final game of the season, De Bruyne reached 20\nassists in the Premier League. This is an amazing feat coming from arguably the\nbest central midfielder in the world. He may be a little disappointed with the\nway him and his team relinquished the League title to Liverpool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Left Attacking Midfield: Sadio Mane.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senegalese had 27 goal contributions, some very important\nones as well. One of the very first names on Liverpool\u2019s team sheet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Right Attacking Midfield: Raheem Sterling.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Manchester City did not have their best season,\nthis year was his best Premier League return in goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forward: Jamie Vardy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a season for the 33 year-old. 23 goals and being the\nhighest goal-scorer in a League that prides itself in its very fit athletes is\na very impressive feat. His team ultimately did not reach the Champions League places\nand that is due to the fact that he did not have enough help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forward: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scoring 22 goals on the left side in attack of a squad that\nhas been at its lowest in a long time is not an easy achievement. Doing it for two\nseasons in a row is just absolutely outrageous.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have finally come to the end of the longest Premier League season.
