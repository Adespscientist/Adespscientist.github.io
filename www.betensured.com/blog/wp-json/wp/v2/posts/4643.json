It is a huge loss to the sporting world and may the\nfamilies that lost people in that crash have the fortitude to bear the loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Barcelona loses under new\nmanagement..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that did not take too long. Barcelona\nhad loads of possession but did not do much with it as they barely had any\nshots on target while Valencia was more direct, heck, they even lost a penalty\nin the process. Lionel Messi was subdued with no support from the midfield or\nhis wide men in Griezmann and Ansu Fati. The reality with this team still is\nthe fact that very little else can be done if Messi does not contribute-\ndirectly or indirectly. Only time will tell if Setien is the right choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Valencia, this was a well deserved win,\nsomething that they had not accomplished since 2007. Things could start to look\nup now as they can kick on towards the Champions League spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Real Madrid wins again..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real Madrid keep doing what they know how\nto do best-not play so well, be very compact at the back and nick in the odd\ngoal or two. This has worked for them so far as they are three points clear at\nthe top. Casemiro got them all the points in the last game-week and Nacho was\nthe one to be thanked for the solitary goal in this game. Thibaut Courtois is\nhaving one of the best seasons in his career and it seems to be gradually going\nunder the radar. All of Real Madrid would want it to stay that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Serie A title race becomes more\nsuspenseful..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Inter Milan drew with Cagliari the day\nbefore, it seemed like Juventus would stroll to struggling Napoli and leave\nwith three points. It was not to be as Napoli gave a good showing, were two\ngoals up before having to dig deep to take all three points. Juventus still\nlead with three points- two if Lazio wins their game in hand. Nothing is set in\nstone yet. This may as well go down the wire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Rome derby, Lazio and Roma were held\nto a draw with a very memorable goal by Acerbi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Atalanta scored 7 goals away\nfrom home. Arguably the most entertaining team in Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>RB Leipzig lose advantage..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leipzig lost away to Freiburg, also not\nscoring in the process. Unfortunately, every other team around them took\nadvantage. The gap has been cut to one point. The pressure is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may need to do an Erling Haaland watch\nat this rate as he has 5 goals in less than 80 minutes. Talk about making a\nmark!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before we begin, let us pay respect to the legendary Kobe Bryant and all those who lost their lives in the helicopter crash yesterday evening.
