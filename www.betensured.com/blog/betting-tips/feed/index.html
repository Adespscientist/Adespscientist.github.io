<p>Do you bet online on sport? What sports do you bet on the most?</p>



<p>Any passionate bettor should know that betting has had quite the evolution, going from roadside kiosks handled by one bookmaker with his really big book, to an integrated website where you can bet on a variety of sports complete with really cool features like customer support, betting tips, better security, strategies and easy access to betting sites via the use of your mobile phone, computer or laptop.</p>



<p>Betting has evolved, and Betensured wanted to know just how much people&#8217;s attitude towards it had changed as well, so we conducted a survey on the pulse of gambling to see how people in Nigeria bet.</p>

<ul><li>Which Gender Bets More</li><li>Which Age Range Bets The Most</li><li>Why Do People Bet?</li><li>Where People Place Their Bets</li><li>Favorite Football Market</li><li>Favourite Sports Market</li><li>Favourite League To Bet On</li><li>How Many Odds Bettors Bet On</li><li>How Many Betting Sites People Use</li></ul>

<p></p>



<p>During our survey, we found that:</p>



<p><strong>1:  Men Bets More Than Women</strong></p>



<p>Our survey reveals that we have more men using online sites to bet more than women. In a similar survey we took in 2019, men still gambled more than women.</p>



<p>This may be due to the fact that men are usually more passionate about sports and are generally more likely to take risks betting on sports.</p>



<p><strong>2: Age Group</strong></p>



<p>From the survey, we noticed that the age group that bet the most, were between the ages of 25-31, making up 33.69% of the bettors.</p>



<p>This shows that online betting is more prominent amongst people in their early twenties and thirties.</p>



<p><strong>3: Why People Bet</strong></p>



<p>When we asked 749 of our bettors why they bet, 610 of them, 81.44% said that they bet for the purpose of making money. That was the largest number of responses we got for this question. In 2019, more people&nbsp; gambled for money.</p>



<p>Online betting is lucrative and some bettors who are really good at it, walk away with wins running into millions and it is a fast way to make money.</p>



<p><strong>4: Which Countries Bet the Most</strong></p>



<p>Our survey showed that out  of the 5 African countries that took the survey, Nigeria had the highest number of bettors. They were 423, 57.48% Nigerians out of 749 people from other African countries and America, who took the survey. Nigerians are passionate about sports, especially football and they have some of the best betting sites like Betensured which is always willing to reward that passion with the best odds, promos, betting strategies and every other thing they&#8217;ll need to make betting and cashing out easy for them </p>



<p><strong>5: Where Do People Bet</strong></p>



<p>Mobile phones are the most preferred medium of placing bets, 66.71% of our bettors agree. In 2019, when we asked our bettors the question &#8220;How Do You Gamble?&#8221; mobile phones were chosen as the least preferred method of betting.</p>



<p>Now, mobile phones are more convenient for placing bets because they&#8217;re easily accessible.</p>



<p><strong>6: The Favourite Betting Markets for Bettors in Nigeria</strong></p>



<p>The Favourite football market for bettors in Nigeria is a straight win, this is according to 35.51% people, 266 bettors, the largest number for this response.</p>



<p><strong>7: Favourite Leaque People Bet On</strong></p>



<p>487 of our bettors, 66.02% say that English Premier League is their favourite league to bet on.</p>



<p>If you are interested, you can check out some <a href="https://www.betensured.com/predictions/football/England-Premier-League">football predictions for our English Premier League.</a></p>



<p><strong>8: Number of Betting Sites People Use</strong></p>



<p>242 of our bettors, 34.33% use two betting websites for betting on sports, this is the highest number for this question. In 2019, when we asked our bettors a similar question: How Many Bookmakers Do You Use? 37.3% of gamblers said they use one bookmaker, that was the highest number of responses at that time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>2019 VS 2021</strong>: <strong>State Of Online Betting In Nigeria</strong></h2>



<p>On comparing the two surveys &#8211; (go here to check out the <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-survey-2019-understand-the-betting-industry/">first survey in 2019</a>), we took on online betting and generally people&#8217;s behavior towards it, we discovered that not much has changed in the past 2 years as we found some similarities in how people bet now and how they bet then.</p>



<p>Similarities in bettors behaviours we found include:</p>



<ul><li>Men bet more than women in 2019 and again in 2021.</li><li>Nigeria still bets more than Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana. We had the highest number of online bettors in both 2019 and 2021.</li><li>The reason with the most response as to why people bet, was for the money. More people bet for money in 2019, and that pattern was repeated in 2021.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<ul><li>97.20% men gamble more than women and only 2.67% women bet.</li><li>70.5% of bettors use one or more than one betting sites.</li><li>81.44% bettors admitted to betting for the purpose of making money.</li><li>33.69% of people between 25-31 years bet more than other age grades.</li><li>Nigeria bets more than other African countries.</li><li>66.7% Bettors agree that mobile phones are the most preferred medium of betting.</li><li>35.51% people agree that a straight win is their favourite football market.</li><li>Our bettors favourite sports market is football, 97.2% agree.</li><li>Favourite league to bet on is European Premier League.</li><li>34.22% of bettors say that the bet on 2 sites.</li></ul>



<p>Online betting has evolved into something better and more convenient than how people used to bet in the past, but while some bettors&#8217; behaviour changed over the years; like going from betting on a road side kiosk to betting with your devices, somethings about betting hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>



<p>From two years ago till now, people continue going into online betting for money as they did two years ago, men are still betting more than women, and Nigeria bets more than other African countries, placed in the same class of countries that are passionate about sports as it is.</p>



<p>We think <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-for-beginners-how-to-bet-on-football/">online betting</a> has come to stay, and the more it grows, the more bettors will find new ways to adapt to these upgrades made to it.</p>

<p>Have you ever gambled online before? How often do you bet on sports?</p>



<p>These days, there is an increased interest in sports betting, primarily because there is a high chance for sports enthusiasts, to win prizes for it, and earn extra income from it.</p>



<p>Sports betting is the easiest way to make money from sports, but it comes with a lot of rules and high stakes which could make your winning impossible if you don&#8217;t understand how they work.</p>



<p>One way to win when betting on sports, besides being really good at predicting outcomes is to find a betting site or book maker with high odds that could favour you.</p>



<p>Based on bonuses they offer to bettors, sports tips, security, success rate, and variety of games to bet on, these are the Best Betting Sites With High Odds.</p>



<p><strong>Guide Content:</strong></p>



<ul><li>How To Place Winning Odds</li><li>How To Get The Best Odds</li><li>Best Betting Sites With High Odds</li><li>Betting Sites That Offer The Best Bonuses</li><li>Top Sites That Offer Free Bets And No Deposit Bonuses</li><li>Best&nbsp; Betting Sites That Offer Accumulator Bonus</li><li>Bookmakers With The Best Betting Boosts</li></ul>



<p>This article is a guide to help you find the best betting sites with the highest odds, by pointing you in the direction of thoroughly vetted betting sites which you can safely place your bets with.</p>



<p><strong>How To Place Winning Odds</strong></p>



<p>Betting odds represent the probability of an event occuring, including the proposed return you as a bettor should receive on a winning bet.</p>



<p>Betting odds also indicate how likely your prediction is, and are represented as decimal, fractional, or American odds.</p>



<p>When it comes to odds, the highest potential return is important, because it endorses the accuracy of your bookmakers odds, and helps you choose the right bookmaker for yourself.</p>



<p>Odds can be confusing and if misunderstood can cost you a lot of money, so we will show you everything you need to know about How To Place Winning Odds so you don&#8217;t lose more money.</p>



<p>This section covers the types of betting odds, how betting odds work, how betting odds are read, how to calculate your winnings with odds, how bookmakers set football odds and live betting and changing odds.</p>



<p><strong>Types Of Betting Odds</strong></p>



<ul><li>Decimal odds</li><li>Fractional Odds</li><li>American Odds</li></ul>



<p>Decimal odds are more common in Nigeria than fractional and American odds, and as such, receive the most focus. American odds are more common in the United States Of America.</p>



<p><strong>How&nbsp; Betting Odds Work</strong></p>



<p>When choosing the right odds for you, there are 3 factors you should consider. These 3 factors are the risk level,&nbsp; the quality of odds, and comparing odds.</p>



<p><strong>Risk Level</strong></p>



<p>You need to choose your preferred risk level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preference for risk level reads as, if you would like a higher chance of getting a wager return for a smaller amount, or a lower chance of getting a wager return but for a higher amount</p>



<p><strong>Quality Of Odds</strong></p>



<p>Vetting the quality of odds is how you make an analysis of betting markets.</p>



<p>Judging the quality of odds on offer is simply what features separate a well-thought out bet, from the one you recklessly placed.</p>



<p>Generally judging the quality of odds, you look at whether they are of good value, based on how the odds stacked up against your prediction of an outcome or your bookmakers prediction.</p>



<p><strong>Comparing&nbsp; Odds</strong></p>



<p>Odds can be compared against their competition so that you can get a high return.</p>



<p>This is done by mathematically determining which of the compared odds can give you the highest betting returns.</p>



<p><strong>How&nbsp; Betting Odds Are Read</strong></p>



<p>To be able to read betting odds, you should know that betting odds are represented as decimal, fractional and American odds. Each betting odd is read in a different way.</p>



<p><strong>Decimal Odds</strong></p>



<p>Decimal odds are easy to read and understand, because the higher your number of odds, the higher your winnings.</p>



<ul><li>To calculate your decimal odds, your winnings are your stake, multiplied by the decimal odds.</li><li>In decimal odds 2.0 is even money, meaning your winnings will be double or x2, and anything less than is an odds-on bet.</li><li>Decimal odds are popular in Nigeria, because they are easy and used by Nigerian betting sites.</li></ul>



<p><strong>American Odds</strong></p>



<p>American odds are used in America, and are more difficult to understand.</p>



<p>American odds use the plus and minus symbol, and number after each show how likely it is for your favourite team&nbsp; to win or lose.</p>



<p>The higher the number after the minus sign,&nbsp; the more likely it is for a team to win, but the higher the number after a plus, the higher the team&#8217;s chances of losing.</p>



<p><strong>Fractional Odds</strong></p>



<p>Just like American odds, fractional odds aren&#8217;t specific to Nigeria, rather they are mainly used in the UK. Fractional odds are used in street betting shops and on horse racing.</p>



<p>In fractional odds, the higher the number of odds, the higher you earn from your bet. For fractional odds the first half represents how much you will win, and second half represents how much you stake.</p>



<p><strong>How To Calculate Your Winnings With Different Betting Odds</strong></p>



<p>Here is a summary of how to calculate your winnings with the different betting odds.</p>



<p><strong>Calculating Winnings With Decimal Odds</strong></p>



<p>To calculate your winnings with decimal odds, multiply your stake by the decimal odds.</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Stake &#8211; ₦10</li><li>Odds &#8211; 2.5</li><li>Winnings = ₦25</li></ul>



<p><strong>Calculating Winnings With Fractional Odds</strong></p>



<p>To calculate your winnings with fractional odds, how much you will win/how much you stake</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>



<ul><li>For a 5/1 odds, you would receive ₦5 for every ₦1 you bet.</li><li>If you are staking a different amount from the given fraction, maybe a ₦3 stake would be 3 x 5, earning you a ₦15.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Calculating Winnings With American Odds</strong></p>



<p>American odds are usually split into two possibilities, minus (-) and plus (+) money lines.</p>



<p>The minus money line is how much you need to bet to win an amount of money while the plus money line is how much you would win if you bet an amount of money.</p>



<p>A N100 bet on a +200 moneyline, would win you ₦200, and a -200 money line requires you to bet&nbsp; ₦200 to receive N100</p>



<p><strong>How Bookmakers Set&nbsp; Football Odds</strong></p>



<p>Your bookmaker isn&#8217;t using magic to set the odds for that football game you bet on, here is how bookmakers set football odds.</p>



<p><strong>Different Predictions</strong></p>



<p>Bookmakers judge the likelihood of an event to occur differently. Each bookmaker based on their predictions, comes up with different conclusions for an odd.</p>



<p>Bookmakers are competitive, so the gap in differences between odds, wouldn&#8217;t be too wide amongst bookies.</p>



<p><strong>Unforeseen Circumstances</strong></p>



<p>A bookmaker&#8217;s odds can be affected by unforeseen circumstances like player injuries, or team lineup which impacted the game, and in turn affected the bookie&#8217;s odds.</p>



<p><strong>Match Timings</strong></p>



<p>Your bookmaker&#8217;s odds can be affected by impromptu match timings as well. If any games happen between the team you wish to bet on and another team within the time of the odds being initially set and the event itself, and the team you bet on plays badly against another team, their odds will lengthen because it&#8217;s a negative sign for their future performance in a match with the team they were initially supposed to play.</p>



<p><strong>The Team&#8217;s History</strong></p>



<p>The history between the two teams playing a match can also affect a bookie&#8217;s odds, as well as other factors like recent form, injury news, and the environment.</p>



<p><strong>Amount Of Money</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes, a bookmaker&#8217;s odds can also be based on the amount of money bookies discover on one side of a wager.</p>



<p>This is because Bookmakers all want to accept your bet, but they are also weighing so many factors to ensure they don&#8217;t lose much money to an incorrect prediction.</p>



<p>Bookmakers may have varying odds,&nbsp; but it&#8217;s just based on different opinions or their reaction to the market and this shouldn&#8217;t be taken in as a quality odd. To ensure that your bookie&#8217;s odds are high quality, you need to consider their over-round and bookmaker&#8217;s margin.</p>



<p><strong>Live Betting And Changing Odds</strong></p>



<p>Bettors need to understand and accept that sometimes, odds for live betting can change.</p>



<p>However, the&nbsp; changes in odds that occur during a live betting are the events of the match which you couldn&#8217;t have predicted before the game started.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s common for changes in odds to occur in live betting as live betting possesses a bigger challenge than pre-match because it is fast-paced and has a lot&nbsp; to take into account.</p>



<p><strong>How To Get The Best Odds</strong></p>



<p>An understanding of how odds work and how to utilise them for your betting, puts you right at the list of bettors to enjoy the best odds offered by bookmakers.</p>



<p>Here is how to get the best odds.</p>



<p><strong>Promotion Odds</strong></p>



<p>A bookmaker can offer you odds as part of their promo as a way to retain your patronage, thankfully these are the best type of odds to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Bookmakers can offer you promotion odds,&nbsp; no matter when you placed your bet. They can also add percentages to your bets, when you utilise a free bet or place accumulator bets.</p>



<p>Prize draws by bookmakers make you qualified to win prizes depending on placement of certain bets, you can have versatile odds on numerous betting sites,&nbsp; as well as thanks to cash-out features.</p>



<p><strong>Betting Sites That Offer Promotion Odds</strong></p>

If you wish to make a killing in online sports betting, there are some fatal mistakes you ought to avoid. They are as follows </p>



<ol><li><strong>Mismanaging
your finances </strong></li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s
quite easy to assume when it comes to betting on a sport. It&#8217;s a deadly mistake
that can cost you. It&#8217;s essential to manage your finances as a bettor. To make
a profit in sports betting, you ought to set aside a budget. Don&#8217;t use any
money that you haven&#8217;t purposed for gambling.</p>

a rule on how much you intend to wager on any bet, including at parlay bets.

chaselosses.&nbsp; </p>



<ul><li><strong>Having
unrealistic expectations </strong></li></ul>



<p>Betting

think again. When you have a predetermined mind in gambling, you might end up
disappointed. </p>



<p>Don’t
despair when you keep making constant losses. However, it doesn&#8217;t have to be
the norm. You need to have basic knowledge about the sport you intend to bet.
Then, have the best gambling tactics. Have an open mind as well as realistic
expectations when it comes to sports betting&nbsp;
</p>



<ul><li><strong>Picking
the wrong online gambling agency </strong></li></ul>



<p>There
are so many online gambling sites that you can select. However, a selection in
the wrong section will cost you money. You need to search for various
trustworthy sites, including <a href="https://www.vegas338.id"><strong>sbobet88</strong></a>.

times you might find the sites are down due to massive traffic. Don&#8217;t call it
quits. You can choose to stake a bet at their alternative links. It&#8217;s a
brilliant opportunity to gamble at any time.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Failure
to compare odds </strong></li></ul>



<p>It&#8217;s
quite simple to compare odds at different online gambling agencies. However,
most punters hardly do that. It leads to not having the best deal. If you wish
to stand out, you need to compare these odds. It will make the slightest
difference, which has a massive impact on the overall profit over time.</p>

any sports betting, you ought to start betting for value. Most tend to ignore
it then end up making losses. A successful bettor always identifies bets which
have value. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean high offs are of paramount importance,
or low odds are of lousy value. A profitable bet is said to have value when it
has a high success rate chance than its odds implies.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Sports Betting?</strong></h2>



<p>Sports betting is a form of gambling that entails placing a wager, also known as a bet, on the outcome of a sporting event.</p>



<h2><strong>Types of sports betting?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Straight Bets</strong>: A betting line is set, which is often referred to as a point spread, and you can either bet on the favorite and give-up the points or place a bet on the underdog and get the points</p>



<p><strong>Total Line bets</strong>: In this type of sports bet, a number is set for the combined final score of both teams and you then bet on the actual score staying “under” that total or going “over” the set number.</p>



<p><strong>Money line bets</strong>: When you make a money line bet, you are picking a team to win straight-up without any point spread.</p>



<p><strong>Parlay Bets</strong>: The act of grouping together two or more picks into one single bet is known as a parlay.</p>



<p><strong>Teaser bets</strong>: A teaser bet is a twist on a parlay in that you are still grouping two or more picks together in a single bet, but you can now tweak the point spreads in your favor in return for a lower overall payout.</p>



<p><strong>Head-to-Head bets</strong>: For sports such as NASCAR and professional golf, a common way to bet these events is to bet on the head-to-head results between just two competitors. Whichever one finishes the race or the tournament in the higher position wins. Many times a money line will be attached to each competitor as a way to handicap the match. This type of bet is very popular for sports such as these considering just how hard it is to pick an outright winner among a very large field.</p>



<h2><strong>Sports Betting Statistics</strong></h2>



<p>1: Global sports betting market was valued at around USD 104.31 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach approximately USD 155.49 billion by 2024, growing at a healthy CAGR of 8.83% between 2018 to 2024</p>



<p>2: 450bn USD is the total global marketing gross gaming yield</p>



<p>3: Estimated global gambling gross win in the us is estimated at $74.39bn</p>

<p>Today marks the official launch of this user-oriented football prediction and analysis website,<strong> Betensured</strong>. &nbsp;We thought it wise to use this blog post to introduce the features of the website and answer every possible question as regards the use of our services.</p>
<p>The very first question in our readers&#8217; &nbsp;mind might be &#8220;<strong>What&#8217;s the meaning of Betensured?</strong>&#8220;. &nbsp;Betensured is derived from two words namely; <em>bet</em> and <em>ensured</em>&nbsp;. The word bet according to googling the word &#8216;bet&#8217; on google means</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To&nbsp;risk a sum of money or valued item against someone else&#8217;s on the basis of the outcome of an unpredictable event such as a race or game</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It says &#8220;<em>Unpredictable event such as a race or game</em>&#8221; but is football actually unpredictable?? <span id="more-20"></span>If Chelsea was topping the table and they had a game against Aston Villa in Chelsea&#8217;s home for instance, and Chelsea has always &nbsp;drawn every match played against Aston Villa in their home, who do you think would win the match?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/how-much-money-does-the-indian-premier-league-make/">Check here to see how much the Indian Premier league is making annually</a></p>
<p>It would be foolhardy to place a bet for Chelsea to win just because they are topping the table. In this case the safest and best thing any professional bettor would do is to place a bet of Home Win Or Draw H(W/d) not an outright Home win. This type of analysis and intelligent prediction shows that betting on football games differs from betting on casino where you just dash free money to the bookmakers. Football outcomes are 80% predictable.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.betensured.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click HERE to use Our Prediction Site</a></span></strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>The second part of the word <em>betensured</em> is the word &#8220;ensure&#8221;. Now we go to google and search what ensure means.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ensure means to make certain that (something) will occur or be the case.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What we try to do is to make sure all our Nigerian users get 80% of their bets correctly. We want to say No to gambling but YES to sports investment and <a href="https://www.betensured.com/">football prediction site</a>. When you place bets without knowledge, you GAMBLE but when you place bets with knowledge you&nbsp;INVEST. In simple terms, we want to make certain that 80% of the time our users place bets via our guidance it would be correct.</p>
<p>With our mission clearly stated, the different features and functionalities of the website would be explained in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>The website was designed to guide Nigerian football punters in 8 different&nbsp;categories to place money when betting on football matches. The eight categories are Sure 5, Take The Risk (TTR), First Half Wins (FHW), First Half Draws (FHD), &nbsp;DRAWS, Double Chance, Over &amp; Under 2.5 GOALS, Over 1.5 GOALS and Both Teams To Score&nbsp;(BTS).</p>
<p><strong>Sure 5</strong></p>
<p>The Sure 5 category was built for sports bettors who are looking for any list of combined matches to accumulate up to 5 odds.&nbsp;The outcomes of each accumulated match may not necessarily give outright wins but may include outcomes such as over 1.5 goals, under 2.5 goals or Both Teams To Score (BTS).</p>
<p><strong>Take The Risk</strong></p>
<p>The Take The Risk category as the name implies refer to matches where the outcomes are tight to predict and as such odds for those matches are very high and provide high value for the bettor</p>
<p><strong>First Half Wins</strong></p>
<p>First Half Wins category displays the matches in which either team playing is predicted to win the first 45 Minutes of the match.The team leading the opponent&nbsp;in the number of goals scored by the exhaustion of the first 45 Minutes, is declared the winner of the first half.</p>
<p><strong>First Half Draws&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First Half Draws&nbsp;category displays the matches in which&nbsp;the teams playing are predicted to have a draw at the end of the first 45 Minutes of the match.</p>
<p><strong>Draws</strong></p>
<p>The Draws category shows the matches that are expected to end in a draw at the end of the 90 Minutes match.</p>
<p><strong>Double Chance</strong></p>
<p>The Double Chance category displays matches that enable the bettor predict two possible chances of a match outcome. The predictions under this category are Home Win or Draw H(W/d) AND Away Win or Draw A(W/d).</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2.5 Goals category displays matches that are predicted to produce a total goal of 3 goals and above.</li>
<li>Under 2.5 Goals category displays matches that are envisaged to produce a total of 2 goals or less</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.5 Goals</strong></p>
<p>Over 1.5 goals category shows the football matches that are estimated to produce &nbsp;a total of 2 goals and above.</p>
<p><strong>BTS</strong></p>
<p>BTS or Both Team To Score for long, describes matches that are predicted to have goals being scored by both teams at least.</p>
<p><strong>Super Weekend</strong></p>
<p>The Super Weekend category displays a list of matches for the weekend -Friday to Sunday- and their predicted outcomes.</p>

<p>Have you heard of matched betting and you keep wondering what it is all about.</p>



<p>If you are new to betting on football or any other type of sports, you will soon learn that there are different types of betting strategies you can deploy.  Check out our <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-guide/">beginner&#8217;s guide to football betting here</a></p>



<p>In this guide, I will be sharing with you some tips and
information on what you need to know about matched betting. </p>



<p><strong>What is matched
betting?</strong></p>



<p>Matched betting has been with us for so long but we turned our backs to it. </p>



<p>Match betting is popularly known as arbitrage promotional offer, It is not a common type of betting in the betting world, although it also depends on the part of the world you are. </p>



<p>Also, matched betting markets which include various types of bonuses with the likes of Bonus Money take this gambling type to an ultimate level. </p>



<p>Using various algorithms and mathematical calculations, its aid bettors to know that with this type of betting, you can never lose. </p>



<p>It started in the United Kingdom but has however spread to other parts of the world. </p>



<p>A Matched Bet happens when you place two contrasting bets in order to minimize your risk. Let us give a vivid explanation of this type of bet:</p>



<p>1. if you place a BACK (it means&nbsp; you bet FOR a sports result) at the Betting
company</p>



<p>2. if you place Lay (means you bet AGAINST a sports result)
at a betting exchange, like Betfarm</p>



<p>For neophytes, a “Lay” bet means you are actually betting against an eventuality by accepting stakes
on it (like a bettor does).</p>



<p>What this implies is that the two bets you stake cancel each other out, leading you to break even. </p>



<p>No profit and no loss. But the aim of gambling is to make a profit, so you have to mix ‘Matched Bet’ with a Free Bet offered by the Betting company </p>



<p>When you do these, then you begin to gain. This is exactly what Matched betting entails </p>



<h2><strong>Best Tips on Matched Betting.</strong></h2>



<p>Since matched betting is not your regular type of betting.
You need some tricks to be successful in it, some of which are provided below:</p>



<p>1. You need to have a funded Betway account (or any other
good betting exchange, Betfair and
bet farm is not bad)</p>



<p>2. New and real betting
account where Free bets can be available for signing up. (Searching on the web
about“free bets “to find one will not be a bad idea.)</p>



<p>3. Adequate money to deposit in the betting company account.</p>



<p>If you are not knowledgeable about the availability
of the kinds of free bets various betting
company offers. Let me give a little bit detailed explanation about it below:</p>



<p>There are two ways Bookie Free Bet/Promotions can be
applied. </p>



<p>1. A gambler must make sure he/she meets a “Rollover
Requirement”. What this means is that you must have
credited some funds into the account of a betting company and this ‘Free
Money’ must be available for your stakes to be placed. Certain stakes must have
been played on some eligible bets before any withdrawal can be allowed (e.g., betway and Bet365).</p>



<p>2. A bettor must
also be eligible and qualified for a Free
Bet. In this scenario, a betting company
makes it compulsory that bettors must
place some kind of “qualifying bet” using their own cash before being any type
of free bet can be given to them. This type of bet is called “Stakes Not
Returned”.</p>



<p>Whatever your case may be your first objective is to minimize losses while the other aim is to make a profit from the free money given by the bookmaker.</p>



<p>Another way you can do this is when you start checking matched betting, it is pertinent you know about the type of sports in which to match your rollover with.</p>



<p>How then can you select the appropriate Sporting Event to stake
on?</p>



<p>Matching your bet will mandate that the Bookmakers (Betfair)
odds are of a related odds. This should not be overlooked</p>



<p>A typical example is
if a gambler stakes a qualifying bet at
the Bookie by backing Manchester United
beat Liverpool FC at decimal odds of 2.60,
whilst Laying Liverpool FC at odds of 2.75 on the Betway exchange. The staker is
actually evening out the Back bet by
betting against Liverpool FC on the exchange.</p>



<p>Moreover, an issue arises when the difference between 2.60 and 2.75 is big with respect to the odds placed on the value of the bet. The bookmaker&#8217;s price is only 81.1% of the Lay odds on Betway. This seems to be a very weak match and it is preferable, you want your Lay odds to be more like 2.70 — a 95% match. The closer the opposite odds, the lesser the risk incurred on your part and the better for you.</p>



<h3>Matched Bet Rugby</h3>



<p>Now you may want to ask if the matched bet is only applicable to football. </p>



<p>It can also be applied to <a href="https://www.betensured.com/rugby-predictions/">rugby</a>, however, you must understand the sport well, the teams playing, and other necessary miscellaneous. </p>



<p>The basics of rugby sports betting must be known to you. The basics of rugby mean getting a circular ball into your opponent’s in-goal area. To place Matched betting in rugby sport, certain things have to be known:</p>



<p>1. The strength of both teams that you want to match
bet on</p>



<p>2. The odds allocated to both teams by bookmakers,
if the Nuggets are given 2.20 to defeat the team from Los Angeles with an odd
of 2.50, then just like it applies to football, the risk is too enormous, and
therefore you must find two teams which opposite odds must be very similar,
something like 2.40 and 2.45.</p>



<p>3. Matched betting in rugby is not as straight forward as the ones in soccer and not all bookies allow matched betting on rugby, therefore check with your bookie.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Matched Betting NFL</strong></h2>



<p>Matched betting in the NFL is very lucrative, this is because unlike most sports odds gave in NFL are very similar and therefore very good with value. </p>



<p>Check teams that are in the same city or under the same ownership, they mostly will have similar odds which can be matched bet to give a reasonable profit. </p>



<p>Also, have at the back your minds the following knowledge:</p>



<p>1. Understanding the point variation available in
the game.</p>



<p>2. Key injuries to star players and suspensions</p>



<p>3. It is better to matched bet two weaker sides than two stronger sides.</p>



<p>4. Know what point’s conversion means and how it
affects your preferred team.</p>



<h2><strong>Matched
betting strategy</strong></h2>



<p>There is some strategy
necessary for you to succeed in matched betting, some of which are highlighted
below:</p>



<p>1. Know that all Free Bets have certain terms and conditions attached to them.</p>



<p>2. Betting companies mandates that an initial qualifying bet
should be staked for a bettor to be
eligible for a free bet. Please, you need
to get it accurate on the very first bet you place with the bookie.</p>



<p>3. Be on the Lookout for certain tricky terminologies that may
inhibit you from been awarded the
promotion. Remember: no free bet means no gain.</p>



<p>4Make sure you have enough adequate
funds (Liquidity) on the Exchange to stake your Lay Bets.</p>



<p>5. Peradventure you notice that there is a shortage of funds on <a href="https://www.betfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Betfair (opens in a new tab)">Betfair</a>, you should consider queuing your bet at a higher price. This will enable you to reduce your liabilities and therefore increase your profits. Another way is that you can risk waiting for your bet to get matched even when there is no guarantee that it will be soonest.</p>



<p>6. Avoid newbies errors: Be careful when you are matching
your bets, a matched bet cannot be unmatched.</p>



<p>7. Either you win, lose or draw, always know that there is
another time and there is a strong possibility of you been successful with a
matched bet than with any other market available there. </p>



<p>8. Don’t forget to use very low odds for qualifying/rollover bets and very huge odds for SNR free to limit your losses and make your profits more viable.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>How to get free bets and bonuses from betting companies</strong></h2>



<p>When bookmakers do not want to give you free bets and bonuses, this may be a problem, because you will not earn anything to play Matched Betting. </p>



<p>What you will have is your bets canceling each other out and you breaking even. You need to realize that free bets are and bonuses are pivotal to your success in matched betting.</p>



<p>However, the problem with getting free bet and bonuses is that they do not come alone or freely but are accompanied by very strict and rigid terms and conditions. </p>



<p>These terms and conditions state what you need to qualify for a free bet, to begin with, various odds that you can bet on, and what requirements have to be met for the bettor to withdraw any funds from the account</p>



<p>How then free bets are
given?</p>



<p>Free bets are promoted for signups in bookmaker’s platform
and they can be advertised like this:</p>



<p>“Bet $40 to get $40 free bet (note that your stakes won’t be
returned)</p>



<p>That means you will have to bet $40 to get a free bet of
exactly the same amount as shown above.</p>



<p>However .the problem is that even if you bet $40, you may
still not get a free bet of $40, however, gambling is not like that, you should
think positive if not betting is not for
you. Therefore, if you don’t risk $40, it is likely you will not get free bets
and bonuses.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Matched betting may be unfamiliar to you, but it is a market worth dabbling into, what you need is to get the basics, and please check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="oddsmonkey.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.oddsmonkey.com/" target="_blank">oddsmonkey.com</a> to get a clearer rate for your matched bet.</p>

<p><strong>What
Makes a Good Sports Betting Site</strong></p>



<p>The online sports betting industry has been experiencing tremendous growth and shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. This means that there are more opportunities for punters across the globe on the internet. While this is a great advantage, especially with the convenience and flexibility that comes with online sports betting, the main challenge comes in selecting a trusted and reliable betting site to entrust with your money, details and have the best betting experience. There are endless choices, and while some like <strong><a href="http://172.96.188.62/">Judi Bola</a></strong> have your best interest at heart, others are only after scamming you and wasting your time. Distinguishing legit sites from scams can be a bit hard, but here are a few tips to make your search easier and more manageable.</p>



<p>PS: Check out <a href="https://www.betensured.com/todays-predictions/">today&#8217;s match prediction</a></p>



<p><strong>Consider
certification</strong></p>



<p>The right betting site
should be certified and approved to offer these services. License is the first
sign to show that the providers take their clients seriously and that you can
trust them. If they are certified, it shows that they have undergone evaluation
and met all the requirements by the authorities. They are also registered, and
if things go wrong, you can easily report them. </p>



<p><strong>Consider
their reputation</strong></p>



<p>You should not rush to
select the first option that comes your way without a background check to see
if they are worth your trust. You can determine a sports betting site&#8217;s
reputation by checking reviews on the website or asking for opinions from your
friends, family, and colleagues who have used it before.</p>



<p><strong>Customer
support</strong></p>



<p>The kind of customer
services you get from a particular site says a lot about the type of providers and
who they are. You will require some help navigating through the website,
signing up, making your first deposit, or even placing the bet. You need
someone to guide you as soon as you need help; otherwise, you will end up with
missed opportunities. You can determine their customer support by checking how
fast they reply to the live chats. If they have excellent customer services, it
shows that they value and care for their clients, and you can, therefore, trust
them.</p>



<p><strong>Check
the available games</strong></p>



<p>The best sites, such as
Judi Bola, have a wide range of games for you to choose from. They understand
that one of bettor&#8217;s favorite sport might not be the other&#8217;s favorite. They,
therefore, do their best to accommodate them all. Also, having access to a
variety of games <strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Successful-Gambler">increases your chances
of winning</a></strong>.</p>



<p><strong>The
available methods of payment</strong></p>



<p>The main reason why bettors prefer online sports betting to traditional wagering is due to convenience and flexibility. This is precisely what you should look for before settling for a particular site. They should offer a range of payment methods to accommodate all bettors regardless of their location. This means that you should be able to deposit money to your account and withdraw at any time and from anywhere. The available payment methods should also be secure.</p>

<p>With these tips, you will
undoubtedly find the right betting site to meet your needs and give you the
best sports betting experience. The search might take some time, but it will be
worth it. </p>

<p>Stuck in that sinking sand of deciding which is&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.boomtownbingo.com/online-slots/best/">the
best slots sites to bet on</a></strong>? At the end of this article, you&#8217;ll
have enough information to make an informed decision. All you need to know &#8211;
the juiciest of deals, bonus codes, and lots of other features that will guide
you &#8211; we provide to you on a platter of gold.</p>



<p>With thousands of assorted games hitting platforms this February alone,
you surely have been wondering what the best choice is for you, but that is no
longer a problem.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<p><strong>Online Slots-What You Should Know</strong></p>



<p>Online slots are quickly becoming a favorite in the industry. Slot
machine games translate really well online, compared to other casino and bingo
games. This is why they&#8217;ve risen in popularity over the last couple of years.
The same software that are used in slot machines on casino floors are also the
ones used in online slot games.</p>



<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s Important that You Know the Best Slot Sites To Bet On</strong></p>



<p>1. The best sites pack a lot of buzzes. The excitement they create knows
no bounds.</p>



<p>2. There&#8217;ll be a lot of online reviews by dedicated players and gurus of
the industry available to help you choose the best game titles.</p>



<p>3. Free games when you don&#8217;t want to stake money. You get to stake your
money only when you want.</p>



<p>4. The platforms are available to you 24/7. You can browse through the
latest online slots at any time.</p>



<p>5. Ability to sign up on the different slot sites and online casinos.
You can also pick your choice from the array of titles and catalogs on offer.</p>



<p>Here are some of the criteria with which we selected our favorite slots
sites for the year:</p>



<p><strong>RTP for Slots</strong></p>



<p>RTP simply means Return To Player ratio. The best online slot sites
provide high RTPs, which means they pay players well! With RTP values, you can
know how frequently (or how much and how well) a game pays out over a
lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Their bonus
programs should offer you a lot of money to spread across different games and
should not be restricted to a select few. We took a careful look at wagering
requirements. You shouldn&#8217;t have to spend more money than is necessary for the
long run.</li><li>The site should be
compatible with your smartphone or tablet. You should be able to download free
apps and programs on it.</li><li>We took a careful
look at the software developers they have and the technology available. We
checked whether or not LIVE PLAY was available. Lastly, we took a look at the
available games on each platform and matched them against other catalogs.</li><li>We verified whether
or not customers can cash out in the same way that you pay in. Are e-wallets
accepted, or is payment restricted to just cards and bank transfers? The best
slots sites (listed below) provide you with a wide array of payment options.</li><li>Payment protection
is paramount. We looked out for their updated security certificates. This told
us whether or not payments are truly secure on the platform.</li><li>We checked if
members could win progressive jackpots if there are regular promotions on the
site, and we took a look at the website&#8217;s licensing. The best sites are fully
licensed and regulated.</li></ul>



<p>Applying all the above criteria thoroughly, these are the online slots
sites that came out on top on our list.</p>



<p><strong>The 12 Best Slot Sites To Bet On and Their Amazing Promotional Offers</strong></p>



<p><strong>1. Bgo Slots</strong></p>



<p>You stand a chance of winning up to 500 free spins.</p>
