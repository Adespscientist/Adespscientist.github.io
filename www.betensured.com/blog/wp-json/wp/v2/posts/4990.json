This may also be leading to poor fitness levels and even injury \u2013 see the injuries to Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne, two very key members of Pep Guardiola\u2019s side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The counter-argument to that is there are other teams that have the same issues as well. Although the current perspective is that the teams that do not have mid-week European engagements look sharper during the weekend games, which ultimately leads to a more exciting Premier League overall. Also, in terms of personnel, only David Silva and Vincent Kompany \u2013 who made 33 and 17 appearances respectively -have been the two major departures from the blue side of Manchester since the last time that they won the League two years ago. There have also been (inevitably) more quality additions as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of injuries, it is a bit ironic that the talismanic Kevin De Bruyne played 19 games and less than a thousand minutes in the season that Manchester City last won the league in the season that Manchester City relinquished the league title to Liverpool by a record number of games left, he played 35 games in the English Premier league and was by far the League\u2019s best player. There is also the curious case of Sergio Aguero, who has not been replaced \u2013 Gabriel Jesus is not an adequate replacement- and who seems to have a huge risk of getting injured after practically every game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second issue -and this may be more controversial- could be that this is probably the farthest that Pep Guardiola can take this Manchester City team to. The Champions League quarter-final loss to Olympique Lyonnais last season could have really dealt all associated with Manchester City a big blow as that was a huge chance for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City to at least move closer to achieving the holy grail of European football.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pep Guardiola is yet to sign a new contract as his current one expires in June 2021. This is also already the longest time that Guardiola has spent in a single club. Let us see if he can (potentially) leave with one last hoorah.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Manchester City has come a long way since their takeover by Sheikh Mansour in 2008: From hiring Mark Hughes as Manager to Roberto Mancini and then Brian Kidd on an interim basis, then to Manuel Pellegrini and then now, Pep Guardiola.
