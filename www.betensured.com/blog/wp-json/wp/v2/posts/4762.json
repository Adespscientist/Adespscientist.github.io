(AP Photo\/Julio Cortez) ORG XMIT: BEL135<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>Belmont Stakes 2020: Who Will Win The First Leg Of The Triple Crown?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Racing fans would have feared the worst for\nthe chances of the Triple Crown going ahead in the USA earlier this year, but\nthe show must still go on. It will be an unprecedented year of the Triple Crown\nthis year, however, as the three-race event will kick off with the race that\ntypically ends the event. The Belmont Stakes will be sticking to near its\noriginal date as it will be run on the 20th June.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kentuckyderby.com\/\">Kentucky\nDerby<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.preakness.com\/\">Preakness Stakes<\/a> will\nboth now take place later in the year, and there will also be a number of other\ndifferences to this year&#8217;s event. The prize pot is slightly smaller than\ntypical, with the prize fund now at $1 million instead of the normal $1.5\nmillion. However, the biggest difference that gamblers should be aware of ahead\nof this year&#8217;s race is the distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally the Belmont Stakes is the\nlongest race of the Triple Crown as it takes place over one and a half miles.\nHowever, this year is has been drastically shortened to ensure that injuries to\nthe horses are less likely, with many runners likely to be suffering from\nstamina issues and fatigue.&nbsp; The new\ndistance of one and one-eighth miles will make the Belmont Stakes the shortest\nof all the Triple Crown races this year. But, has that had a bearing on which\nhorse may potentially start the opening leg of the Triple Crown as the\nfavourite?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tiz The Law To Start Off As Favourite<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiz The Law will remain the favourite\nheading into the Belmont Stakes, as the three-year-old comes into the race off\nan impressive set of form in 2020. The dominance that Tiz The law has enjoyed\nthis year so far has been mightily eye-catching for gamblers. His first run\nthis year came at Gulfstream Park, where he won by a dominant three lengths from\nEte Indien. He followed this up with another impressive showing at the end of\nMarch at the same track, as Tiz The Law won by four and a quarter lengths from\nShivaree.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Credible Chances<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will still be some doubting the\nthree-year-olds credentials as his run before these two successes saw him\nfinish third at Churchill Downs. Gamblers will also be aware of the other\nfavourites in the race, which are Charlatan and Nadal. Bob Baffert trains\nCharlatan, and there is still a feeling that the three-year-old is somewhat\nunknown. He has only appeared on one previous occasion, with that ending with a\nwin at Oak by six lengths over Basin. But, gamblers will be wary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nadal is also trained by Baffert but does\nhave more weight behind his odds. He has won on all three outings, which\nincluded a win at Oak on the 3rd May. He was dominant on that occasion as he\nwon by three lengths. His other two victories have also come this year, with\none coming in February over Ginobili and the other coming in March over\nExcession at Oak. Out of the two Baffert trained horses among the favourites,\nthe preference would be for Nadal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outsiders For The Belmont Stakes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The remainder of the field will be priced\nat above +1000, with Honor A.P being the best fancied of the outsiders. There will\nbe doubt surrounding whether the John Shirreffs trained horse will be able to\ncompete having won just once in three starts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other realistic chances that could\ncause a shock are Sole Volante and Dr Post. The latter of those may get some\nattention having won emphatically on his last start at the end of March. His\nprice could tumble should he pick up another win before the June Triple Crown\nevent.
