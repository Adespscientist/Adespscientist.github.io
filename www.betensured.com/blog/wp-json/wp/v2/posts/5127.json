We advise you to stay with us because we are going to preview it in these <a href=\"https:\/\/bethome.org\/\">free soccer predictions for today<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>France are the favourites in Group D, but we suspect it won\u2019t be an easy ride for them. Teams such as Ukraine, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Finland could turn out to be tough opponents. Les Bleus must show their best football in order to win the first place in the group. At the same time Didier Deschamps\u2019 team is rarely lacking consistency, so don\u2019t be surprised if they win the first place again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Didier Deschamps\u2019 left Barcelona\u2019s Samuel Umiti out of the team for the next matches because of him lacking playing time. At the same time he called again the Old Guard in the face of Antoine Griezmann, Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappe, N\u2019Golo Kante and Raphael Varane. Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Tanguy Ndombele, Olympique Lyonnais\u2019 Leo Dubois and Monaco\u2019s Wissam Ben Yedder got called up for the next three games as well. Except Ukraine, France are going to face Kazakhstan and Bosnia-Herzegovina as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most likely Ukraine still remember what happened to them when they faced France in a friendly game in Paris in October. It was a catastrophic event for the Ukrainians who suffered a humilating 1-7 defeat at the Stade de France. Although it was just a friendly match, such a performance can\u2019t be forgotten easily. Viktor Tsyhankov scored Ukraine\u2019s only goal in this game while Giroud, Camavinga, Tolisso, Griezmann and Mbappe scored for the world champions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>France played their last game in November when they faced Sweden in the Nations League. The match in Paris ended with a 4-2 win for the hosts which allowed them to win their group and reach the next phase of the competition. Olivier Giroud scored a brace for France while Pavard and Coman scored as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine lost four of their last five matches which is not speaking well of their shape lately. In their last game Andriy Shevchenko\u2019s boys faced Switzerland in the Nations League, but the game ended with a dominant 3-0 win for the Swiss side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atalanta\u2019s Ruslan Malinovskyi is one of Ukraine\u2019s best performers at the moment. The 27-years old midfielder is the player to watch in Shevchenko\u2019s team. Malinovskiy is playing in terrific way since his move to Italy and until recently we had the chance to watch him in the Champions League with La Dea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gent\u2019s Roman Yaremchuk and Shakhtar\u2019s Junior Moraes are the two players in attack who can cause France some problems. Yaremchuk has a good consistency with the national team as he scored 6 goals in 19 matches for Ukraine. He\u2019s scoring on a regular basis in the Belgian league as well, so France should keep an eye on him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manchester City\u2019s Oleksandr Zinchenko is one of Ukraine\u2019s most progressing players in the last year or two. For Man City he\u2019s usually playing in defense, but Andriy Shevchenko prefers to use him as a midfielder. West Ham United\u2019s Andriy Yarmolenko is another Ukrainian player who currently plays in the Premier League. You can see that Shevchenko has some solid team on his disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s our <a href=\"https:\/\/bethome.org\/\">free soccer predictions for today<\/a> for the World Cup qualifying fixture between France and Ukraine on Wednesday. Everyone expects to see the world champions get a winning start of their campaign, but we should not underrestimate the Ukrainian side.
