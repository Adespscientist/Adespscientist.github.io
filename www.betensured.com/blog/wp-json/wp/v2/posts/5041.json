The result was more or less expected. However, when you have the bulk of possession in the second half when you are a goal down, there should be more creativity and penetration in your approach play. Unfortunately, that is not what one has come to expect of Arsenal of recent. Make no mistake about it now, Arsenal is in a relegation dogfight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Everton , defeating Chelsea, Leicester and Arsenal on the trot while conceding a single goal would be a very big boost for Carlo Ancelotti and his men especially considering the fact that some of their stalwarts had been out of sorts recently. Everton is up to fourth position. What a season they are having!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>AC Milan back on track!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After consecutive draws to Genoa and Parma, AC Milan knew that they had to win their game away to Sassuolo as Inter Milan and Juventus were breathing down their necks. The absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ante Rebic would most likely have made scoring more difficult for the Rossoneri, Well, they made their intentions known as early as possible with Rafael Leao scoring for AC Milan 6.2 seconds after kick-off, making that the fastest goal in Serie A history. They eventually came out with a 2-1 win, scoring at least two goals in all their Serie A games this season, a very impressive return. Stefano Pioli and AC Milan would be counting the days till their talismanic Zlatan Ibrahimovic returns from injury in order to continue their title challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Bayern Munich leads the log..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bayern Munich is not at the peak of their powers as evidenced by the statistic that they have been behind in their last 7 consecutive Bundesliga games. Over the weekend, they were on the back foot \u2013 especially in the first half -and were still able to win a very key game in this Bundesliga campaign. Bayer Leverkusen did not deserve to lose but their lack of concentration towards the end of both halves means that Bayern Munich will go into the winter break on top of the Bundesliga without actually lighting up the League. Bayern Munich would definitely have to step up if they want to maintain their position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Leverkusen \u2013 or \u2018neverkusen\u2019 as some would say- they should go into the break and learn from that very bitter defeat. School-boy mistakes will definitely make them lose games and they would also need to convert more chances when the opportunities present themselves to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Paris St Germain cannot displace Lille..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any team that is short of the talents of Neymar and Mbappe would feel it, and rightly so. However, for this expensively assembled PSG team, there should seemingly be more variety. Over the weekend, none of that was on show. Table-topping Lille went toe-to-toe with PSG, kept a clean sheet and still maintained their top spot, same points as PSG. Lyon is a further point behind and if Olympique Marseille wins their two games in hand, they would go top. Interesting times in France, interesting times in the French First Division.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Arsenal fail again\u2026 For the umpteenth matchday, Arsenal lose another Premier League game.
