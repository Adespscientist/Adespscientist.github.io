That is why teams winning the same\ntrophies every year in the same League for a long time could get really boring\n(you, Old Lady, you).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Liverpool and their fans, they would not mind. After\nwaiting for exactly 30 years to win the League, they would not mind winning\nnine consecutive Premier League trophies like Juventus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, to begin, they would have to first win consecutive\nLeague titles, starting with this coming season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool has been on the up in recent years: Champions\nLeague winners 2018\/2019 season, Premier League runner-up in the same season\nwith a points tally that would have won the title in practically every other\nseason and English Premier League winners 2019\/2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have to go at it again in the next couple of weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the lockdown, Liverpool have not been at their very\nbest. This could be due to the fact that they had already won the League. It\ncould also be due to the fact that they have not been very good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool\u2019s structure has not really changed; apart from the\nsigning of Konstantinos &#8220;Kostas&#8221; Tsimikas as a\nback-up left back, they have the same players as no one has left, which\nwould mean that their style of play would most likely be the same as it would\nbe difficult to change the structure in terms of play with the same personnel\nwhich then means that opposition teams would have a better understanding on how\nto handle them. This lack of change could lead to a certain level of\ncomplacency, something that Jurgen Klopp and his staff would be looking to\navoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool, with all their dynamism and energy, lack\ncreativity in the middle of the pitch. Teams that decide to sit back have a\nchance as this Liverpool side tends to send in a lot of crosses -from Trent\nAlexander Arnold from the right and Andrew Robertson from the left &#8211; due to the\nlack of vision in the middle (see Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, Watford,\nWest Ham (H), Burnley (H) in the Premier League, Arsenal in the Community\nShield, albeit a pre-season game, and so on). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean that the signing of Thiago could not be more\nimportant at this point. The ability to pick out passes in forward areas and in\nkey positions would be highly needed as teams are beginning to understand that\ngoing toe-to-toe with Liverpool is not a very sound tactical idea. Naby Keita\nhas tried in that regard but he has not really lived up to expectation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, with all that has been said, Liverpool have been\ngetting better season in, season out in the last three years. The main concern\nright now would be to maintain their levels of performance from last season.\nOr, can they get even better? Now, that would be some sight to see. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The special thing about football for a neutral is the anticipation, uncertainty and entertainment.
