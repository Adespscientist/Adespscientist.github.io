Yes, we know that the Ligue 1 started\nbefore this weekend and some other Leagues as well. But football is back!\nUnfortunately, we still do not have fans back at the stadiums yet which is\nquite understandable seeing as the pandemic has not been totally eradicated. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weekend showed up some good games, especially with the\nopening of the English Premier League 2020\/2021 season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Ruthless Arsenal off to a bright start..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For neutrals, the Arsenal result is nothing surprising. This\nis because Arsenal is arguable the least dependable team in the \u2018top six\u2019. They\ncan play good football, as seen in the weekend, the question is always how\nfrequently they can do it. Against Fulham, debutants Gabriel Magalhaes and\nWillian were very good and were involved in goals. Asides Gabriel\u2019s mistake\nthat led to Leno acting quickly to save the situation, he was very assured and\ncontrolling. Willian was also very bright and popped up in good spaces,\nultimately being involved in all the goals. If he continues like this, what\nhappens to 72 million Pound signing Nicolas Pepe? It is still early days, but\nit would be amazing to see how Arteta handles this squad that has about 7\ncentral defenders. Arsenal fans can look forward to this season in high\nanticipation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Fulham, they were unlucky to start the season playing against\na very good Arsenal side. They did not have a lot of chances as Arsenal was in\ncontrol for virtually the whole game. There is still a long way to go and the\nearlier they start picking up points, the better for the Scott Parker\u2019s team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Liverpool edge it in unconvincing win.. Leeds United a\nwelcome addition..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the neutrals could not wait to have Leeds United\nback into the Premier League and they did not disappoint. Against the Champions,\naway from home, they held their own, came back from a goal down three times and\nwere very unlucky to go back to Elland Road with nothing. However, if they\ncontinue playing in this style, they would ultimately have no problem avoiding relegation\nthis season. However, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s teams tend to tire in the second half of\nseason in previous years due to the high energy running and pressing of the\nplayers. Let us hope that this season will be different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Liverpool, three points is all that would matter for\nnow. In order for them to match or surpass their impressive feat of last\nseason, they would have to step up massively. Trent Alexander Arnold and Virgil\nVan Dijk were surprisingly poor on the day and it would be expected that the\nperformances they put it would not be a continuous occurrence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Le Classique ends in controversy..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline should be Paris St. Germain not winning their\nfirst two Ligue 1 games and not scoring a goal but due to the nature in which\nthe game ended, there were other causes for concern. The game ended with some kicking,\npunching and some head-slapping, with the referee having to issue 5 red cards\nto boot. Neymar got sent off as well and he has come out to say that he was\nracially abused. This is not something to be taken lightly as Marseille has\nalso come out to defend their player(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of the game, PSG had more chances but were very\npoor in finishing. It is not a coincidence that PSG has not scored in the last\ntwo League games and Mbappe has also not played in those games. If this\ncontinues, then this would be a huge concern for PSG.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Marseille, they took full advantage and that is all that\ncounts at this moment. Winning at the Parc de Princes has not been an easy accomplishment\nin recent years. Keeping a clean sheet is an obviously added bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a neutral\u2019s perspective, we may now have a Ligue 1\ntitle race on our hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Valencia starts on a high note\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerning this Valencia side, a lot has happened in the\npast few months. From the internal turmoil to the departure of their Manager to\nthe sale of their captain and other key players- see Rodrigo and Ferran Torres\nto Leeds United and Manchester City respectively, winning their first game and\nscoring four goals in the process would definitely be a welcome result. All that\nis left is for the Manager to keep his house in order. Easy task no?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Football is back.
