Especially when it\u2019s a tournament, you don\u2019t want to miss a single game lined up. But what are the other ways to watch it? Here are some that you can try out to get the best game experience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Watch It Live<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Watching it in a stadium is the best experience if you are an avid fan of sports. Nothing beats seeing the players battle it out on the field and hearing the crowds cheering their teams on. While watching live games is more expensive than watching it from your home (with transportation, food, and parking costs included), it\u2019s still worth it to watch especially if it\u2019s your favourite team. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Watch on Cable Channels<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s\nyour good old cable sports channels. If you are subscribed, then your local\ncable provider will most likely have at least ESPN available. Some regional\nsports networks also show live games. However, if you don\u2019t have a cable, you\nmight need to pay for a temporary subscription. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Hulu Live TV, <a href=\"https:\/\/tv.youtube.com\/welcome\/\">YouTube TV<\/a> both include ESPN plus other networks like TNT, TBS, and NBCSN. What\u2019s great about having cable TV is you can watch in the comfort of your home. You can invite friends over or you can just watch it by yourself, whatever fits your boat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Stream Online<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Streaming\nonline is one of the relatively new ways to watch sports live. You can watch\nthem on your TV, tablet, or mobile device. Most streaming sites require you to\nhave a monthly subscription. These subscriptions also vary on the packages and\nthe content that you get to watch. For obvious reasons, you need to pay more to\nwatch more content or so you can connect it to more devices. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/bettingworx.com\/best-live-streaming-apps\/\">bookies offering free streaming<\/a> apps that not only allow you to stream but also bet live. Far from the traditional viewing of shows and games, you can also bet online with other people. This is great for people who love betting during games. Now, you don\u2019t have to be physically present in a game to win money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Go to Your Local Pub<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pubs are one of\nthe most reliable sources for sports games. It\u2019s either they play a movie or a\ngame, but it\u2019s the latter especially when it\u2019s the finals. If you love watching\nwith a crowd but definitely can\u2019t watch live, a pub is your best bet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most pubs have\nlarge flat-screen TVs mounted on walls and some even have promos when you dine\nor drink during a big game. This might be costly especially if you end up\nordering so much, but at least you\u2019ll be watching with people who are as\nenthusiastic as you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t buy tickets to\nthe game, you don\u2019t have to worry now. With so many ways to watch from where\nyou are, you can surely watch the games live without missing a beat. You can\neven start betting remotely!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Best Ways to Watch a Sports Game Sports is one of the most exciting events to watch live.
