David identifies with his Nigerian roots but represents the Austrian National team, the country of his birth.<br>David mentioned one time in the news he was never approached by the Nigerian FA, one would wonder what those in that glass house do. Nigeria has not had a proper left-back since Taiye Taiwo left the National team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dele Alli<\/strong><br>Bamidele Alli is one of the best young players in the world in his position.
