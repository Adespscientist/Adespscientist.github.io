Where do we start?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would believe that most of us (a lot of us) are aware of Zinedine\nZidane\u2019s glorious playing career. His highlights as a player, to mention a few,\nread thus: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1996: Moved to Juventus from Bordeaux.<\/li><li>1998: Scored two goals in the World Cup Final to\nbeat a very fancied Brazilian side.<\/li><li>2000: Player of the Euro Tournament, a tournament in\nwhich his French National Team won.<\/li><li>2001: Signed to Real Madrid as the most expensive\nfootballer at the time.<\/li><li>2002: Scored \u2018that\u2019 goal that happened to be the\nwinner against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League Final.<\/li><li>2006: Lost the World Cup Final to Italy via\npenalties. Was still voted as the Player of the Tournament even though he got\nsent off for head-butting Marco Materazzi.<\/li><li>2006: Retired as a footballer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is more but his career as a Coach is of particular interest here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After taking over mid-season from a struggling Rafael Benitez\u2019s Real\nMadrid, Coach Zidane has been working some magic ever since.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winning not two (which was not done at the time he achieved it) but three\nconsecutive Champions League titles was nothing short of extraordinary. He won\na League and Champions League double in his first full season at the club in\nthe 2016\/2017 season. To explain further, Real Madrid had won the League once\nin nine seasons before then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shockingly, the football world was seemingly not in agreement that\nZinedine Zidane was a magician. From making use of his team to the fullest \u2013\nespecially by resting Ronaldo \u2013 so as to get the maximum out of his key\npersonnel in important games to now creating this defensive machine sans\nRonaldo is nothing short of extraordinary. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his third Champions League, he left for unclear reasons (his \u2018need\nfor change\u2019 reason was not particularly clear) but would come back after the\nJulen Lopetegui signing debacle and the team struggled after losing arguably\ntheir best ever player in Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus. The loss of Ronaldo\nmore or less culminated in their very forgettable 2018\/2019 season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this season -especially in the La Liga- has been nothing short\nof phenomenal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty-one players have scored for Real Madrid so far this season. Twenty-one!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zidane\u2019s Real Madrid are not the best goal-scorers in the La-Liga,\naveraging a little over two goals per game with 68 goals in 37 games, with only\nKarim Benzema and Sergio Ramos reaching double figures. However, it is the\nrearguard action that should be effusively praised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To concede approximately 0.6 goals per game in 37 games especially in a\nLeague that seems to boast a lot of technical attacking players is out of this\nworld. Credit has to go to Thibaut Courtois especially considering his\ncolourless performances last season. Even 100 million signing Eden Hazard had practically\nno effect for Real Madrid throughout the season even with the season extension\ndue to the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zinedine Zidane has coached professionally for approximately four seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His trophies? 2 La Liga titles, 3 Champions League titles, 2 Club World\nCups, 2 Spanish Super Cups, 2 European Super Cups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give a better context; Zidane has always won a trophy in all of his\nfull seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zinedine Zidane, winner of 11 trophies in about 4 years and managing the\nbiggest (and arguably the most difficult) European Club is still not\nunanimously recognized as one of the best Managers to have ever done it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there still any doubts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The doubts should have evaporated some time ago. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get with the program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zinedine Yazid Zidane.
