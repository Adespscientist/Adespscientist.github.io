David Luiz started in midfield in the reverse game &#8211;\u00a0a 3-3 draw at Stamford Bridge\u00a0two weeks ago &#8211; but played in defence at the Stadio Olimpico. Centre-back Gary Cahill replaced Davide Zappacosta from Saturday&#8217;s win over Bournemouth, meaning a reshuffle with Cesar Azpilicueta moving to the right.<\/p>\n<p>They actually should have been 1-0 up within 21 seconds &#8211; when Pedro shot straight at Alisson Becker &#8211; before El Shaarawy scored the sixth quickest Champions League goal of the past decade, following good work from ex-City pair Kolarov and Dzeko.<\/p>\n<p>Chelsea had plenty of shots &#8211; but rarely looked like scoring, with the lively Hazard forcing two saves and shooting wide. Morata also missed a sitter and Marcos Alonso forced a good diving save with an effort from the corner of the box.<\/p>\n<p>But the Blues were error-ridden at the back. They should have conceded when Luiz made a mistake on the halfway line and El Shaarawy played in Dzeko, whose shot was saved.<\/p>\n<p>They trailed 2-0 when Rudiger, a summer signing from the Italian side, let Nainggolan&#8217;s pass bounce and El Shaarawy took advantage to score past the onrushing Thibaut Courtois.<\/p>\n<p>Things did not improve when Antonio Conte brought on Willian for captain Cahill, moving Pedro to the right &#8211; and the Spaniard let Perotti go past him with no other defenders shutting the Argentine down before he smashed in the third.<\/p>\n<p>They were lucky not to concede again with defending resembling football seen on five-a-side pitches &#8211; or school yards &#8211; across the world. All three Chelsea centre-backs ran to Dzeko &#8211; with two men free in the centre but Perotti got it wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Courtois denied Kostas Manolas&#8217; header with a good reaction save as Chelsea were just glad to get off the pitch at the end.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">Morata struggling for confidence<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \"><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \"><\/figcaption><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \"><img data-attachment-id=\"3406\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/chelsea-lose-championship-league-game-to-clinical-roma\/_98561777_morata\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?fit=624%2C351&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"624,351\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"_98561777_morata\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?fit=624%2C351&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3406\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?resize=624%2C351\" alt=\"_98561777_morata\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/98561777_morata.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figcaption><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">Alvaro Morata only had 26 touches &#8211; missing two chances &#8211; before being withdrawn<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Chelsea striker Morata had another disappointing evening in front of goal.<\/p>\n<p>The 25-year-old Spain forward, a \u00a360m summer signing from Real Madrid, had scored seven goals in his first eight games in English football.<\/p>\n<p>But it is now six games in a row without scoring and he was replaced by Michy Batshuayi with 15 minutes left.<\/p>\n<p>At 1-0, he missed a glorious chance to score.
