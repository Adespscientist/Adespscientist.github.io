The two-day meeting is home to three Group 1 races, and none more prestigious than the festival\u2019s namesake, the Derby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Racing fans and connections will now be gearing up for the next big meeting \u2013 Royal Ascot \u2013 which takes place this week. While you\u2019re looking for the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betdaq.com\/exchange\/horse-racing\/100004\">horse racing tips<\/a>, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the big winners at Epsom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>The Oaks: <em>Snowfall<\/em><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third of five British Classics, the Oaks is only open to fillies, and it was <em>Snowfall<\/em> who handed trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien yet another win in the race \u2013 his ninth victory since 1998. Frankie Dettori was in the saddle, as he rode <em>Snowfall <\/em>to a record 16-length victory, surpassing the previous record set by <em>Sun Princess <\/em>in 1983 \u2013 to also notch his sixth Oaks winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese-bred filly started off towards the rear of the pack, but Dettori powered on through the rain, taking the lead with just under two furlongs to go. It was an impressive finish that saw the duo push on and go clear in the final furlong. Stablemate <em>Divinely <\/em>finished in third, while the favourite, <em>Santa Barbara<\/em>,also from O\u2019Brien\u2019s yard could only finish fifth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Coronation Cup: <em>Pyledriver<\/em><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a new winning trainer in the Coronation Cup, as William Muir &amp; Chris Grassick\u2019s <em>Pyledriver <\/em>won in what proved to be a thrilling race. <em>Al Aasy <\/em>was the pre-race favourite, and was denied in the closing stages, having held up in rear in the early stages, before going on to lead in the final furlong. A neck separated first from second, while <em>Japan<\/em>, trained by O\u2019Brien finished in third, seven lengths behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a first Group 1 victory for <em>Pyledriver <\/em>with Martin Dwyer in the saddle. The jockey has now won all three of Epsom\u2019s centrepiece races \u2013 his previous wins include the Oaks (<em>Casual Look<\/em> in 2003) and the Derby (<em>Sir Percy<\/em> in 2006). On completing the hat-trick of Group 1s at Epsom, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.racingbetter.co.uk\/epsom_derby\/coronation_cup.html\">Dwyer said<\/a>;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s special. If you\u2019re not fashionable it\u2019s hard to get good rides. Sometimes you feel you are defending yourself if you don\u2019t win. Half my worry was losing the ride on him. When it comes right and you win a big race, you enjoy it that bit more. I\u2019m very excited. He can only get better.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>The Derby: <em>Adayar<\/em><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a surprise win, as 16\/1 shout <em>Adayar <\/em>won the Derby. Jockey, Adam Kirby had been scheduled to ride <em>John Leeper<\/em>, before Frankie Dettori was called up \u2013 and instead, Kirby was handed <em>Adayar<\/em> \u2013 replacing Oisin Murphy in the saddle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was a move that appeared to pay off, as Kirby guided <em>Adayar <\/em>to victory by four and a half lengths over 50\/1 chance <em>Mojo Star <\/em>in second, and <em>Hurricane Lane <\/em>in third. It\u2019s not the first time that Kirby has defied the odds, having won at Royal Ascot last year, when riding <em>Nando Parrado <\/em>in the Group 2 Coventry Stakes \u2013 a rank outsider at 150\/1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sport\/horse-racing\/57370912\">the jockey\u2019s reaction<\/a> at the finish line said it all:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis is the Derby lads &#8211; get in there!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this month, the Derby Festival took place at the picturesque Epsom Downs.
