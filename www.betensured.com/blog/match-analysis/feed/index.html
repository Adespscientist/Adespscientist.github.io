<h2> Everton vs Crystal Palace </h2>

<ul><li><strong>Everton form: LWDDW</strong></li><li><strong>Crystal Palace form: DDDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>Everton now look like a cohesive unit under Carlo Ancelotti, and this was shown in the 3-2 comeback win against Watford. Since his appointment, they have picked up 15-points in 8 matches, leaving them 4-points behind 5<sup>th</sup> placed Tottenham. Carlito has turned Goodison Park into a fortress, where they are unbeaten in the last 5 matches and conceded only 3-goals. This is particularly evidenced by Mason Holgate who has transformed into a gallant composed Center-Back. Toffees should handle Roy Hodgson’s side who can’t find goals. </p>



<p>The Eagles on the other hand are experiencing a downturn in form, as  defeat to Sheffield meant 6 PL matches without a victory. The great start to the season leaves them in a healthy position so no cause for concern. However they need to start scoring goals, which means relying on Ivorian Wilfried Zaha. Expect a win for Everton with few goals.</p>



<h2>Brighton vs Watford</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Brighton form: DLDLD</strong></li><li><strong>Watford form: WWDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>The Seagulls continue to play some nice football but they exemplify the saying ‘good for nothing.’ They have just (1) win in the last 10 PL matches. With all their football, they are 15<sup>th</sup> position in the table, just 2-points off relegation. After missing a good opportunity to beat an abysmal West Ham, they face a tougher opponent in Watford, who pose a different challenge. The Hornets will not make this an easy contest.</p>



<p>Watford suffered their first back-to-back defeat under Nigel Pearson and they are looking to get back to winning ways to jump out of relegation zone. They make it difficult to score them when playing Away and utilising Delofeu on the counter has helped free up space- but it is clear they have struggled without Senegal international Ismaila Sarr. This should be an even game, but Watford will try to knick a scrappy win.</p>



<h2>Sheffield Utd vs Bournemouth</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Sheffield Un</strong>i<strong>t</strong>e<strong>d form: LWDLW</strong></li><li><strong>Bournemouth&#8217;s form: LLLWW</strong></li></ul>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side earned a massive 3-points against Crystal Palace to move ahead of Man Utd- they are 5-points off top 4 and a win will send them to 5<sup>th</sup> position for a week. Their manager’s remarkable tactical knowledge has seen the pre-season relegation favourites now fighting for Europe. The Blades should secure a win against Bournemouth </p>



<p>Bournemouth meanwhile are still in trouble despite their back-to-back victories. Their Away form is a joke- they have lost 4 out of last 5 matches and scored just (1) goal. Last season’s wonder Ryan Fraser is without a goal involvement in the last 14 matches and that sums up the teams’ form. This plays into Sheffield Utd’s hands nicely, as their defence need not worry too much about the attacking threat. </p>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side will continue their defensive football, with new signing Sander Berge adding dynamism and a robust edge to their midfield. &nbsp;They should see out a win, but expect few goals in this match.</p>



<h2>Man City vs West Ham</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Man City form: WWDWL</strong></li><li><strong>West Ham form: LDLLD</strong></li></ul>



<p>Defending champions Man City were dealt a heavy blow in the 2-0 loss to Tottenham that put them out of the title race. But they have 2<sup>nd</sup> place to fight for with Leicester. They also have other cup competitions coming up, especially the Champions League. Still, West Ham should be an easy tie for Guardiola’s men if the manager can listen to his players and stop rotating the team. The Sky Blues simply need to plug the hole in the defence. So with Laporte returning for this tie, there might be a cleansheet here.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sterling is out with a hamstring injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11927880/raheem-sterling-ruled-out-of-manchester-city-vs-west-ham-with-hamstring-injury" target="_blank">Sterling is out with a hamstring injury</a>, which means Aguero and Mahrez are the ones to watch. Europe’s best attack have scored an average of 2-goals in the last 5 matches at Home and have won 3 of those games.</p>



<p>The Hammers are back to square one after the 4-0 win against Bournemouth renewed hope. But what did they really expect from out of touch Moyes? The meltdown against Brighton extended their winless run to 5 PL games and now they are 18<sup>th</sup>. The Hammers have lost 4 out of the last 5 Away, conceding 9-goals.</p>



<p>Man City will set up as usual, operation attack, while West Ham are expected to park the bus. The reverse fixture saw a 5-0 demolition, so expect goals in this one, especially in the Second Half. It should be a comfortable evening for the Citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before we begin, let us pay respect to the
legendary Kobe Bryant and all those who lost their lives in the helicopter
crash yesterday evening. It is a huge loss to the sporting world and may the
families that lost people in that crash have the fortitude to bear the loss.</p>



<p><strong><em>Barcelona loses under new
management..</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, that did not take too long. Barcelona
had loads of possession but did not do much with it as they barely had any
shots on target while Valencia was more direct, heck, they even lost a penalty
in the process. Lionel Messi was subdued with no support from the midfield or
his wide men in Griezmann and Ansu Fati. The reality with this team still is
the fact that very little else can be done if Messi does not contribute-
directly or indirectly. Only time will tell if Setien is the right choice.</p>



<p>For Valencia, this was a well deserved win,
something that they had not accomplished since 2007. Things could start to look
up now as they can kick on towards the Champions League spot.</p>



<p><strong><em>Real Madrid wins again..</em></strong></p>



<p>Real Madrid keep doing what they know how
to do best-not play so well, be very compact at the back and nick in the odd
goal or two. This has worked for them so far as they are three points clear at
the top. Casemiro got them all the points in the last game-week and Nacho was
the one to be thanked for the solitary goal in this game. Thibaut Courtois is
having one of the best seasons in his career and it seems to be gradually going
under the radar. All of Real Madrid would want it to stay that way.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Serie A title race becomes more
suspenseful..</em></strong></p>



<p>When Inter Milan drew with Cagliari the day
before, it seemed like Juventus would stroll to struggling Napoli and leave
with three points. It was not to be as Napoli gave a good showing, were two
goals up before having to dig deep to take all three points. Juventus still
lead with three points- two if Lazio wins their game in hand. Nothing is set in
stone yet. This may as well go down the wire.</p>



<p>In the Rome derby, Lazio and Roma were held
to a draw with a very memorable goal by Acerbi.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Atalanta scored 7 goals away
from home. Arguably the most entertaining team in Europe.</p>



<p><strong><em>RB Leipzig lose advantage..</em></strong></p>



<p>Leipzig lost away to Freiburg, also not
scoring in the process. Unfortunately, every other team around them took
advantage. The gap has been cut to one point. The pressure is on.</p>



<p>We may need to do an Erling Haaland watch
at this rate as he has 5 goals in less than 80 minutes. Talk about making a
mark!</p>

<p><strong><em>Liverpool cannot be stopped..</em></strong></p>



<p>Liverpool has been so good in the past 18
months that their last two games – against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester
United – are regarded as ‘lucky wins’ by some due to the fact that the
opposition could have taken points had their finishing been any better. This is
now 1001 days since Liverpool lost at Anfield. We do not even want to do the
mathematics on this one. The only recent thing about this Liverpool side in the
past few games was the fact that they have been unable to finish teams when
they had chances. Liverpool is 16 points from second – Manchester City in case
you think it is Leicester – and still have a game in hand. Something
inexplicable would have to happen at Anfield for them not to win this trophy.
After 30 years!</p>



<p>For Manchester United, the simple fact is
that Rashford was missed. With all the money that has been spent in the past,
that is a very surprising statement to make. A lot of these players are not
good enough to play in this Club and that is the bitter truth at Old Trafford.</p>



<p><strong><em>Bundesliga opens with a flurry..</em></strong></p>



<p>The stand-out game over the weekend was
obviously the one that Dortmund played in. A certain 19-year old came on in the
second half- Manchester United, you remember him? &#8211; and had 3 goals in a very
short period. (We got information that in Germany, a hat-trick is scored only
when the goals are scored in the first half and there are no goals scored in
between the three goals). Erling Haaland, what a way to start a career in
Germany.</p>



<p>RB Leipzig had to come from behind to
maintain top spot. Timo Werner, their talisman, bagged a brace and is looking
like the real deal now. The only question right now is if they can keep up the
momentum till the end of the season and become champions of Germany, especially
with Bayern Munich not letting up.</p>



<p><strong><em>Serie A taking shape.</em></strong></p>



<p>Inter Milan could only manage a draw,
Juventus took full advantage and Lazio, who are on an eleven-game winning
streak thrashed Sampdoria and could move ahead of Inter Milan with a game in
hand. Juventus would have to dig deep to get to the finish line. Zlatan
Ibrahimovic did not score for AC Milan. However, it is not just a coincidence
that AC Milan started winning games shortly after signing Zlatan.</p>



<p><strong><em>Barcelona wins under new Management..</em></strong></p>



<p>Barcelona may not have won by a lot of
goals, but there was a bit of improvement under Quique Setien. This may a bit
early to judge but there will have to be some adjustments especially after Luis
Suarez underwent an operation. How Ernesto Valverde was sacked may be up for
debate but this Barcelona squad would have to step up quickly because their
rivals, Real Madrid, are not letting up.</p>

<p><strong><em>Real Madrid win yet another trophy..</em></strong></p>



<p>How important this trophy ultimately is may
be up for debate but we cannot ignore the fact that this Real Madrid side has
really stepped up their game in recent months. The final- versus Atletico Madrid-
was not a great spectacle up until the last few minutes in extra-time when
Alvaro Morata was clean on goal and Valverde ‘took one for the team’. The
result is more impressive when you realise that Real Madrid were without Karim
Benzema and Gareth Bale. Another trophy for Zinedine Zidane. Nine out of nine
finals won now.</p>



<p>For Atletico Madrid especially under Diego
Simeone, they would give any team a run for their money but cannot seem to
finish teams when chanced. Joao Felix had a chance early on and snatched at it,
Alvaro Morata also had a chance but hit a very tame effort to the in-form
Courtois. When you bear in mind that they play Liverpool in Champions League
next month, you wonder if they stand any chance.</p>



<p><strong><em>Paris St. Germain held by Monaco..</em></strong></p>



<p>The game itself would ultimately most
likely be inconsequential- I mean that PSG would win the League eventually, in
case you do not understand- but Monaco put up a good fight, having to come from
behind twice. For PSG, the Holy Grail is still the Champions League (they would
be happy that they have a fit and happy Neymar this time, fingers crossed) but
winning the Ligue 1 would still be the barest minimum achievable.</p>



<p><strong><em>Liverpool cannot be stopped..</em></strong></p>



<p>Most neutrals were looking forward to this
game &#8211; you know, Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers, clowns, Jose Mourinho, Chelsea,
the Gerrard slip, etcetera? However, Liverpool was in control of this game save
for the last 20 minutes following the inclusion of Lo Celso and Lamela.
Ultimately, over the course of 90 minutes, Liverpool deserved the win. This
time, Firmino was the man with the solitary goal. Liverpool has now gone 38
games unbeaten- albeit in two different seasons- dropping only two points away
to Manchester United. Next up for the Reds: Manchester United. Let us see the
version of Manchester United that Solskjaer serves up for the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Serie A is the League to watch
this season..</em></strong></p>



<p>Whether it is because Antonio Conte is
doing wonders with Inter Milan or Maurizio Sarri is still having some
difficulty in determining his best way to play in Juventus or the magic that
Simone Inzaghi is performing with Lazio, the Serie A is the League that may go
to the wire this season. Over the weekend, Inter Milan hosted a very good
Atalanta side and were held to a draw. Inter Milan did not deserve to win it as
they were poor especially in the second half. Juventus went away to Roma and
duly took advantage, although they also did not have a good second half after
being two goals up very early in the game. The lead is now two points. If Lazio
wins their game in hand which is highly possible considering their blistering
form, they would be a point behind second placed Inter Milan. Juventus cannot
afford to look down.</p>

<p>Everton and Arsenal kick-off this weekend&#8217;s English Premier League action. Both teams are in transition and will be looking for a win to ease their incoming managers into difficult jobs. The 5pm (CAT) matches see mid-table clubs battle for 3-points, while Wolves look to bounce back against Norwich. It ends with a blockbuster match when Man City take on Leicester in a battle for the second-best team in England.</p>

<p>After a spirited performance against Leicester that saw them knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties, the Toffees will be looking to repeat those efforts when Arsenal come to Goodison Park. Ferguson will continue his tactics of dogged defending and counters, which will make Arsenal attackers work hard for goals. Top boy Richarlison could cause problems for the Gunners. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Arsenal are recovering from a Kevin De Bruyne masterclass that proved why they shouldn&#8217;t be in the top-6. Their fans will be happy this is Ljungberg&#8217;s final game as caretaker- he looks as clueless as Steve Kean at Blackburn. He will be looking to Martinelli&#8217;s energy, and Aubameyang to help him finish on a high. Despite their poor form, the Gunners know how to handle Everton, with 4 wins in the last 5 meetings.</p>



<p>Both clubs cannot keep a cleansheet so there should be goals in this one- Everton players will be tired from the midweeek action. Arsenal on the other hand just can&#8217;t defend. So the game will be a matter of who can cut out unforced errors.</p>



<h2>Aston Villa vs Southampton</h2>



<p>Villans showed no mercy in the 5-0 demolition of Liverpool&#8217;s kids on Tuesday. They will carry the momentum when playing a Southampton side that really should be in the Championship. With their incredible home form and return of Jack Grealish to the starting line-up, they should put in a confident performance this Saturday.</p>



<p>Southampton can&#8217;t seem to catch a break anywhere. To add to their Away woes, last week they lost 1-0 to West Ham at Home- which sapped their morale. However, they have Danny Ings to call upon in times like these. He has an incredible 9 goals already and can score against a substandard Villa defence. Expect a proper relegation fight.</p>



<h2>Bournemouth vs Burnley </h2>



<p>Bournemouth shocked everyone with a win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge despite their injury crisis. They are without a recognised back four, Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson and Josh King are also doubts. So they might struggle in front of goal against Burnley.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the Clarets rarely score goals, as they are so focused on defending. Meaning this match should have few goals in it. Burnley might edge the game out simply because they have a fit squad, not because they are better. This will be a scrappy contest. </p>



<h2>Brighton vs Sheffield United</h2>



<p>Brighton is a team that doesn&#8217;t make too much noise. They play good football, and have taken big scalps such as Tottenham, this season. The only thing left is to be pragmatic- and that is exactly what they need to be against Sheffield Utd to earn 3 points. Neil Maupay and co have the tools to break down a dogged Sheffield Utd&#8217;s defence. </p>



<p>The Blades on the other hand are the most defensive newly-promoted side ever. No one has figured our Chris Wilder&#8217;s tactics of overlapping center-backs and shifting formations. Hence why they haven&#8217;t conceded more than 1 goal Away in the past 5 games. Lundstrum and Fleck are in fine form and can come up with goals when Mousset can&#8217;t. This should be an even contest.</p>



<h2>Newcastle vs Crystal Palace</h2>



<p>Newcastle are unbeaten in the last 7 Home games, so will go into this game confident of avoiding defeat. However, without maverick Allan Saint-Maximin (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who tried to rainbow flick a 6 ft 4 player (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.planetfootball.com/trending/allan-saint-maximin-tried-to-rainbow-flick-a-6ft-4in-defender-were-all-for-it/" target="_blank">who tried to rainbow flick a 6ft 4 Sebastian Haller</a>) they must rely on Almiron, Shelvey, and Joelinton. Crystal Palace have a simple strategy of collecting 3-points here and there to avoid relegation- park the bus. Zaha and co can cause problems for Newcastle, but there will be few goals.</p>



<h2>Norwich vs Wolves </h2>



<p>In 19th position, Norwich will most likely be relegated. They have shipped in 14 goals in the last 5 Home games. Their bravery in attack is a breath of fresh air, but they remind everyone of Blackpool in the 2010-11 season. Wolves on the other hand are hurt by a 2-1 defeat to Tottenham, and will unleash their anger on Norwich. It should be an easy win for Wolves who have too much in their arsenal to hurt Norwich up-front, and avoid conceding chances at the back.</p>



<h2>Manchester City vs Leicester</h2>

<p>The champions have largely disappointed this season- owing to injuries and defensive vulnerabilities. They have lost 3 games at Home, the most in Guardiola&#8217;s career.  So the news that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Aguero and Stones have returned to training (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2019/december/man-city-team-news-leicester-pep-guardiola-interview" target="_blank">Aguero and Stones have returned to training</a> couldn&#8217;t come at a better time for the Citizens. They need to win to close the gap with 2nd-place Leicester. De Bruyne and Sterling will have to step up to down the Foxes- they are the ones to watch for City.</p>



<p>Leicester, like City are celebrating progress to the Semis of Carabao Cup, as they chase silverware this season. However, after an unwise decision to play their strongest side in midweek, it will be interesting to see how they fare against the Sky Blues.</p>



<p>The same cannot be said for City whose squad is so deep, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/9699559/mourinho-man-city-b-win-premier-league-man-utd-sky-sports-chelsea/" target="_blank">Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders</a>. Yes Leicester will rely on Vardy, but the truth is the midfield core (Maddison, Tielemans and Ndidi) need to put in a season defining performance for the Foxes to take any point.</p>



<p>City do score a lot of goals and trust Guardiola to stick with his system of trying to overload the Foxes with wave after wave of attacks. However, this is one of Man City&#8217;s toughest fixtures. Last seasons game proves it. Club legend Kompany had to produce a strike from the gods to beat Leicester and secure the title. So this game should be a cracker for the neutrals.</p>

<ul><li> The Special One welcomes the club he once loved wearing the badge of bitter rivals Spurs</li><li>Chelsea face another big-six rival after a horrible run of form, wishing Hazard was here to save them</li></ul>



<p>Not to be superstitious or anything but since Jose Mourinho was unveiled as Tottenham&#8217;s manager, Chelsea&#8217;s form took a dramatic nosedive. The Blues have won an abysmal 2 in 7 games, and they were fragile 2-1 wins.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in North London, a refreshed Mourinho has settled in well, cooling the Spurs seat, and steering his team from 14th position in the league to 3-points away from the final UEFA Champions League spot (Chelsea is 4th). The Special One goes up against Lampard for the second time. The two enjoyed success in the early 2000s, forming a core part of Chelsea&#8217;s golden years, but on Sunday they go head to head as bitter London rivals.</p>



<p>Tottenham welcome Chelsea to their glamorous stadium for the first time on Sunday 22nd December 2019 in the mouth-watering clash of the weekend. This is a fixture that rarely ends as a draw as both tend to go all or nothing. So who will give their fans an early Christmas present?</p>



<h2>Mourinho Looking to School Lampard</h2>

</div></div>



<p>Tottenham form: <strong>WWLWW</strong> </p>



<p>Spurs impressed last time out, beating Wolves in a hard-fought battle at the Molineux, taking a huge stride towards top-4. Right now they look like the only team ready to secure the final Champions League spot. They are unbeaten at Home in the last 5 games, have a fantastic manager, a great squad, and the players are beaming with joy.</p>



<p>Earlier this season, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Portuguese warned that the Blues will miss out on the top-4 because they lack the pragmatism to control big games (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7671113/Mourinho-claims-Chelsea-not-make-two-doubts-ability-handle-big-sides.html" target="_blank">the Portuguese warned that the Blues will miss out on the top-4 because they lack the pragmatism to control big games</a>. A lesson that should&#8217;ve been taken seriously. The Blues have lost all games against the big boys this season. So does Mourinho have a point? This young Chelsea side are naive thinking they can match rivals toe to toe- and he will try to teach his counterpart this lesson on Sunday.</p>



<p>Spurs players have quickly grasped their manager&#8217;s demands. The counter-attacking 4-2-3-1 system makes the most sense with the players on ground. So their raw pace and technique should expose Chelsea&#8217;s weaknesses on the counter. Indeed Tottenham will fashion a few clear-cut chances.</p>



<p>Although this is a rivalry, Spurs have the key to unlock Chelsea&#8217;s defence- we can expect a lot of goals in this one.  The devastation the quartet can cause on a very good day was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mentioned before (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/big-match-preview-man-utd-vs-tottenham-gw15/?preview_id=4392&amp;preview_nonce=bb3aef3f57&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=4419" target="_blank">mentioned before</a>, therefore they will be licking their lips when facing a porous Chelsea defence. Heung-Min Son put in a world-class performance last time in this fixture, so he is the one to watch out for. It would be interesting to see him go up against Azpilicueta.</p>



<h2>Young Blues Need New Ideas to Arrest Poor Form</h2>



<p>Chelsea form: <strong>LLWLL</strong></p>



<p>Chelsea fans were confused after witnessing a heart-breaking 4-0 defeat to Man Utd in Lampard&#8217;s first game as manager. The young Blues outplayed their opponents for 90 mins, but four simple counter-attacking moves rendered the performance useless. Little did they know, this was a sign of things to come- Lampard&#8217;s Chelsea cannot beat big teams. So it&#8217;s cringe that assistant manager <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jody Morris sees the funny side (opens in a new tab)" href="https://talksport.com/football/634517/jose-mourinho-chelsea-record-big-six-frank-lampard-man-city/" target="_blank">Jody Morris sees the funny side</a> of this.</p>



<p>Too many people have rightly complained about Chelsea&#8217;s defence and goalkeeper. They have kept 1 clean-sheet in the last 10 games. With most goals coming in the second-half when concentration levels drop. So expect them to concede again. </p>



<p>In the past five games, teams have figured out how to deal with Chelsea- just defend deep, limit their attackers spaces, and close down Jorginho. This led to Tammy Abraham struggling to score when facing gallant defenders. Now the Pensioners are starting to miss Eden Hazard&#8217;s magic- in times like these, he would just pick up the ball and do something crazy that leads to a goal. Lampard is expecting Pulisic to do the same, but how?</p>



<p>The Blues manager has only one style of play, relying on high pressing, quick direct passing, and keeping possession. When it works Chelsea look like world-beaters, but when it doesn&#8217;t they look like Norwich. We&#8217;ll have to see which Chelsea turns up on Sunday- indeed they have players that can cause problems for Spurs. So this should be a very good game.</p>



<h2>Team News and Likely Line-ups</h2>



<p>For Tottenham, Tanguy Ndombele is sidelined with a groin injury. Ben Davies, Lamela, and Lloris are all ruled out. Harry Winks is back from injury but might be on the bench for this one, with Eric Dier set to keep his place. Mourinho will stick with his trusted 4-2-3-1 formation, with the aim of hitting Chelsea on the counter. It is likely they will defend deep, and afford little spaces for the Blues attackers. He will probably name an unchanged line-up from last time.</p>

<p>Chelsea have a relatively fit squad. Loftus-Cheek was seen back in training, doing some light ball work. Although Tomori is back, he will not be fit in time, and Giroud has a slight ankle injury. If a pragmatic Chelsea turns up they would ditch the usual 4-5-1 formation and adopt a 3-4-3 to avoid counter-attacks and give the defence a stronger shield. This will also allow the wing-backs to be more involved in the game when the attackers can&#8217;t get space. This is the expected line-up.</p>

<p><strong><em>Manchester is Red…you read that right</em></strong></p>



<p>Manchester City came into this game fully aware that failure
to keep up with Liverpool would potentially spell the end of the season’s title
race. Well, the result was commensurate with the performance. Manchester United
had a game plan from the outset and stuck with it throughout which was mightily
impressive. They mostly made the right decisions whenever they played on the
counter attack and duly deserved their win. Manchester United is unbeaten against
the ‘top teams’ in the Premier League this season. They are quite devastating
on the counter and their game plan does not necessarily depend on holding on to
the ball for too long. The glaring issue seems to be when they play the smaller
teams that sit back and let Manchester United do all the playing. The lack of
creativity in the middle and the make-up of their forwards – the likes of
Rashford, James and Martial seem to like running into spaces in the final
third- seems to put them at a disadvantage when they do not play against teams
like Manchester City. That would need to be looked into.</p>



<p>For Manchester City, the middle was always overrun with
almost every Manchester United counter-attack. They missed the midfield muscle
of Fernandinho. Oh, he was playing alright, but was playing in the wrong
position. Rodri has so far shown that he can move the ball well but was
practically non-existent whenever Manchester United charged forward. Is the
title race over for the blue side of Manchester? Not mathematically it isn’t.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Old Lady finally falls..</em></strong></p>



<p>The fact is that Juventus has not set the Serie A and the
Champions League alight. They have struggled in practically all their games.
Many thought that Juventus would go back on top after Inter Milan’s draw with
Roma. Against Lazio at the Stadio Olympico, their run came to an end. You would
not have bet against them coming away with something had Juan Cuardado not been
sent off. Their best player was Wojciech Szczseny, who made some spectacular
saves, especially the penalty and the rebound. Ultimately, there is only so
much that you can do when your team goes a man down and is poor defensively on
the night. Fortunately, all is not lost for Juventus and Maurizio Sarri as they
are only two points behind Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan. Do not blink just yet.</p>



<p><strong><em>Bayern Munich loses again…</em></strong></p>



<p>Bayern Munich lost for the second consecutive weekend to
table topping Borussia Mochengladbach and are down to seventh place in the
Bundesliga. If you saw this game, the Bayern players were so wasteful in front
of goal – yes, Mr. Lewandowski, I am looking at you – and were eventually
punish via a last minute penalty. Luckily for Bayern Munich, the lead is not
insurmountable – only seven points- but one is beginning to get the feeling
that once Lewandowski does not find the back of the net, not many other people
can. That is a game plan that may need to be looked at as the bad spell has
coincided with his own dry spell. Another loss and it would be extremely
difficult to recover.</p>



<p><strong><em>El Clasico finely poised..</em></strong></p>



<p>Real Madrid and Barcelona are joint top of the La Liga table
with 34 points this season. Both teams have not really been at their best this
season. Both teams have had some shocking results this season. Unfortunately,
no other team has been able to take advantage of their frailties – side eye to
Diego Simeone and Atletico Madrid. If this trend continues, the first El
Clasico of the season slated for the 18<sup>th</sup> of December would have an
impact on La Liga proceedings- bar any postponement. We cannot wait!</p>

<ul><li>Both clubs secured a win in preparation for the clash</li><li>This game is more than 3 points. Who will make more noise on Saturday night?</li></ul>



<p>Conventional thinking sees this game is one-sided and easy to call, ‘Of course Guardiola’s men are better than their rivals! Easy win for the Citizens.’ But this could not be farther from the truth. Anything can happen in a Manchester Derby.</p>



<p>Just when you think United are on the ropes, they come up with an unexpected haymaker. The match (at 19:30 CAT) comes before the Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr II fight, so we’ll be glued to our TVs for a while. Who will claim bragging rights in the biggest game of the season? </p>



<p>It never fails to live up to expectations, and rarely produces draws. The last four matches have averaged 3.5 goals, so most are expecting goals. Guardiola’s men are fresh from a 4-1 victory at Burnley and are looking to maintain momentum to catch up to league leaders Liverpool. While Solskjaer’s United are looking to build on the confidence after beating Spurs on Wednesday night. Neither look impressive at the back, in fact, they record 0 clean sheets in their last 5 games.</p>

<h2>The Champions are Fired Up</h2>



<p>The Citizens secured a vital win against Burnley after failing to beat Newcastle. There’s a sense that the title belongs to Liverpool, not only because of City’s setbacks (injuries, VAR decisions, shady defending), but because the Reds seem to be dancing their way to glory. This will motivate Pep and his men more than anything else.</p>



<p>The game is at the Etihad stadium, and the Citizens have scored a crazy 43 goals in 15 games. So everyone will be expecting goals from the Home side. Be careful though, the Sky Blues are without legend Aguero who has 8 goals in 11 games in this fixture. Sterling, De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus will have to step up. Jesus is expected to fill the boots of Aguero and write his name in the history books. With the ridiculous support structure behind him, the Brazilian will be looking to score tomorrow.</p>



<p>City look very unsettled in defence without key man Laporte. Although Fernandinho is trying, he is not a natural defender and is prone to errors that lead to costly set-pieces in dangerous areas. Pep has been looking to rectify that, insisting that the Brazilian is his main man in defence right now. Indeed, they almost kept a clean sheet against Burnley but a lapse in concentration in the 89<sup>th</sup> minute meant they conceded again!</p>



<h2>Momentum Breeds Confidence- United Feeling Good
Again</h2>



<p>Solskjaer summed up his team&#8217;s mood right now when he said ‘Confidence is a strange thing in football, you can get a performance and a result like Wednesday night and it boosts it so much and I know our boys will be up for it.’ </p>



<p>He didn’t stop there, he took a sly dig at the noisy neighbours about the derby saying <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/man-utd-boss-solskjaer-aims-cheeky-derby-dig-at-city-at-least-we-/1ntx1z47mfe001hc2i9mve41al">‘At least we play every year now.</a>’ Reminding Man City followers of their poor history (It wasn’t too long ago City were competing in League One).</p>



<p>Man
United are 6<sup>th</sup> in the league and 8 points from Chelsea and the final
CL spot, so will be looking for a win here.</p>



<p>Marcus Rashford is leading United’s resurgence, and is a goal away from his record 10 in a full PL season. <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/big-match-preview-man-utd-vs-tottenham-gw15/">We mentioned he would be the decider on Wednesday night</a> and he did not disappoint.  As a local lad he knows what this Derby means, so there’s no doubt he will be the one to watch out for as he relishes big games like these.</p>



<p>On the other hand, United’s defence is shaky to say the least. They have conceded in each of their last 10 games, which comes as a surprise as their fans claim to have the best goalkeeper in the world. They possibly have their best back four available, but haven’t look convincing all season. </p>



<h2>Team News and Likely Line-up</h2>



<p>In terms of injuries, City are without Laporte, Sane, Aguero, and Zinchenko. The Citizens will play their usual 4-3-3 formation, with high octane fluid football- taking the game to united. They will look for an early goal to break United’s resolve and force Solskjaer to change his tactics. City&#8217;s defence needs repair as they look to cut off Rashford’s supply line. If they cannot put the brakes on Rashford and James they might be in for trouble. This is the expected line-up.</p>

<p>As for Man Utd, they are without Rojo, Bailly, Dalot, Matic, and Pogba. Martial is a doubt but should be in contention. The Red Devils will likely employ a 3-4-3 formation with a low block, to limit the spaces for City wingers. They are likely going to try and hit City on the counter through the flanks. The game plan will be to try to contain a City onslaught and take advantage of their adventurous wingbacks when they are out of position. This is the expected line up for the Red Devils.</p>
