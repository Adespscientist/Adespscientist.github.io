<ul><li><strong>Everton form: LWDDW</strong></li><li><strong>Crystal Palace form: DDDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>Everton now look like a cohesive unit under Carlo Ancelotti, and this was shown in the 3-2 comeback win against Watford. Since his appointment, they have picked up 15-points in 8 matches, leaving them 4-points behind 5<sup>th</sup> placed Tottenham. Carlito has turned Goodison Park into a fortress, where they are unbeaten in the last 5 matches and conceded only 3-goals. This is particularly evidenced by Mason Holgate who has transformed into a gallant composed Center-Back. Toffees should handle Roy Hodgson’s side who can’t find goals. </p>



<p>The Eagles on the other hand are experiencing a downturn in form, as  defeat to Sheffield meant 6 PL matches without a victory. The great start to the season leaves them in a healthy position so no cause for concern. However they need to start scoring goals, which means relying on Ivorian Wilfried Zaha. Expect a win for Everton with few goals.</p>



<h2>Brighton vs Watford</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Brighton form: DLDLD</strong></li><li><strong>Watford form: WWDLL</strong></li></ul>



<p>The Seagulls continue to play some nice football but they exemplify the saying ‘good for nothing.’ They have just (1) win in the last 10 PL matches. With all their football, they are 15<sup>th</sup> position in the table, just 2-points off relegation. After missing a good opportunity to beat an abysmal West Ham, they face a tougher opponent in Watford, who pose a different challenge. The Hornets will not make this an easy contest.</p>



<p>Watford suffered their first back-to-back defeat under Nigel Pearson and they are looking to get back to winning ways to jump out of relegation zone. They make it difficult to score them when playing Away and utilising Delofeu on the counter has helped free up space- but it is clear they have struggled without Senegal international Ismaila Sarr. This should be an even game, but Watford will try to knick a scrappy win.</p>



<h2>Sheffield Utd vs Bournemouth</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Sheffield Un</strong>i<strong>t</strong>e<strong>d form: LWDLW</strong></li><li><strong>Bournemouth&#8217;s form: LLLWW</strong></li></ul>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side earned a massive 3-points against Crystal Palace to move ahead of Man Utd- they are 5-points off top 4 and a win will send them to 5<sup>th</sup> position for a week. Their manager’s remarkable tactical knowledge has seen the pre-season relegation favourites now fighting for Europe. The Blades should secure a win against Bournemouth </p>



<p>Bournemouth meanwhile are still in trouble despite their back-to-back victories. Their Away form is a joke- they have lost 4 out of last 5 matches and scored just (1) goal. Last season’s wonder Ryan Fraser is without a goal involvement in the last 14 matches and that sums up the teams’ form. This plays into Sheffield Utd’s hands nicely, as their defence need not worry too much about the attacking threat. </p>



<p>Chris Wilder’s side will continue their defensive football, with new signing Sander Berge adding dynamism and a robust edge to their midfield. &nbsp;They should see out a win, but expect few goals in this match.</p>



<h2>Man City vs West Ham</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Man City form: WWDWL</strong></li><li><strong>West Ham form: LDLLD</strong></li></ul>



<p>Defending champions Man City were dealt a heavy blow in the 2-0 loss to Tottenham that put them out of the title race. But they have 2<sup>nd</sup> place to fight for with Leicester. They also have other cup competitions coming up, especially the Champions League. Still, West Ham should be an easy tie for Guardiola’s men if the manager can listen to his players and stop rotating the team. The Sky Blues simply need to plug the hole in the defence. So with Laporte returning for this tie, there might be a cleansheet here.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sterling is out with a hamstring injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11927880/raheem-sterling-ruled-out-of-manchester-city-vs-west-ham-with-hamstring-injury" target="_blank">Sterling is out with a hamstring injury</a>, which means Aguero and Mahrez are the ones to watch. Europe’s best attack have scored an average of 2-goals in the last 5 matches at Home and have won 3 of those games.</p>



<p>The Hammers are back to square one after the 4-0 win against Bournemouth renewed hope. But what did they really expect from out of touch Moyes? The meltdown against Brighton extended their winless run to 5 PL games and now they are 18<sup>th</sup>. The Hammers have lost 4 out of the last 5 Away, conceding 9-goals.</p>



<p>Man City will set up as usual, operation attack, while West Ham are expected to park the bus. The reverse fixture saw a 5-0 demolition, so expect goals in this one, especially in the Second Half. It should be a comfortable evening for the Citizens.</p>

<p>After a spirited performance against Leicester that saw them knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties, the Toffees will be looking to repeat those efforts when Arsenal come to Goodison Park. Ferguson will continue his tactics of dogged defending and counters, which will make Arsenal attackers work hard for goals. Top boy Richarlison could cause problems for the Gunners. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Arsenal are recovering from a Kevin De Bruyne masterclass that proved why they shouldn&#8217;t be in the top-6. Their fans will be happy this is Ljungberg&#8217;s final game as caretaker- he looks as clueless as Steve Kean at Blackburn. He will be looking to Martinelli&#8217;s energy, and Aubameyang to help him finish on a high. Despite their poor form, the Gunners know how to handle Everton, with 4 wins in the last 5 meetings.</p>



<p>Both clubs cannot keep a cleansheet so there should be goals in this one- Everton players will be tired from the midweeek action. Arsenal on the other hand just can&#8217;t defend. So the game will be a matter of who can cut out unforced errors.</p>



<h2>Aston Villa vs Southampton</h2>



<p>Villans showed no mercy in the 5-0 demolition of Liverpool&#8217;s kids on Tuesday. They will carry the momentum when playing a Southampton side that really should be in the Championship. With their incredible home form and return of Jack Grealish to the starting line-up, they should put in a confident performance this Saturday.</p>



<p>Southampton can&#8217;t seem to catch a break anywhere. To add to their Away woes, last week they lost 1-0 to West Ham at Home- which sapped their morale. However, they have Danny Ings to call upon in times like these. He has an incredible 9 goals already and can score against a substandard Villa defence. Expect a proper relegation fight.</p>



<h2>Bournemouth vs Burnley </h2>



<p>Bournemouth shocked everyone with a win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge despite their injury crisis. They are without a recognised back four, Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson and Josh King are also doubts. So they might struggle in front of goal against Burnley.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the Clarets rarely score goals, as they are so focused on defending. Meaning this match should have few goals in it. Burnley might edge the game out simply because they have a fit squad, not because they are better. This will be a scrappy contest. </p>



<h2>Brighton vs Sheffield United</h2>



<p>Brighton is a team that doesn&#8217;t make too much noise. They play good football, and have taken big scalps such as Tottenham, this season. The only thing left is to be pragmatic- and that is exactly what they need to be against Sheffield Utd to earn 3 points. Neil Maupay and co have the tools to break down a dogged Sheffield Utd&#8217;s defence. </p>



<p>The Blades on the other hand are the most defensive newly-promoted side ever. No one has figured our Chris Wilder&#8217;s tactics of overlapping center-backs and shifting formations. Hence why they haven&#8217;t conceded more than 1 goal Away in the past 5 games. Lundstrum and Fleck are in fine form and can come up with goals when Mousset can&#8217;t. This should be an even contest.</p>



<h2>Newcastle vs Crystal Palace</h2>



<p>Newcastle are unbeaten in the last 7 Home games, so will go into this game confident of avoiding defeat. However, without maverick Allan Saint-Maximin (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who tried to rainbow flick a 6 ft 4 player (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.planetfootball.com/trending/allan-saint-maximin-tried-to-rainbow-flick-a-6ft-4in-defender-were-all-for-it/" target="_blank">who tried to rainbow flick a 6ft 4 Sebastian Haller</a>) they must rely on Almiron, Shelvey, and Joelinton. Crystal Palace have a simple strategy of collecting 3-points here and there to avoid relegation- park the bus. Zaha and co can cause problems for Newcastle, but there will be few goals.</p>



<h2>Norwich vs Wolves </h2>



<p>In 19th position, Norwich will most likely be relegated. They have shipped in 14 goals in the last 5 Home games. Their bravery in attack is a breath of fresh air, but they remind everyone of Blackpool in the 2010-11 season. Wolves on the other hand are hurt by a 2-1 defeat to Tottenham, and will unleash their anger on Norwich. It should be an easy win for Wolves who have too much in their arsenal to hurt Norwich up-front, and avoid conceding chances at the back.</p>



<h2>Manchester City vs Leicester</h2>

<p>The champions have largely disappointed this season- owing to injuries and defensive vulnerabilities. They have lost 3 games at Home, the most in Guardiola&#8217;s career.  So the news that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Aguero and Stones have returned to training (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2019/december/man-city-team-news-leicester-pep-guardiola-interview" target="_blank">Aguero and Stones have returned to training</a> couldn&#8217;t come at a better time for the Citizens. They need to win to close the gap with 2nd-place Leicester. De Bruyne and Sterling will have to step up to down the Foxes- they are the ones to watch for City.</p>



<p>Leicester, like City are celebrating progress to the Semis of Carabao Cup, as they chase silverware this season. However, after an unwise decision to play their strongest side in midweek, it will be interesting to see how they fare against the Sky Blues.</p>



<p>The same cannot be said for City whose squad is so deep, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/9699559/mourinho-man-city-b-win-premier-league-man-utd-sky-sports-chelsea/" target="_blank">Mourinho once claimed the B-team are title contenders</a>. Yes Leicester will rely on Vardy, but the truth is the midfield core (Maddison, Tielemans and Ndidi) need to put in a season defining performance for the Foxes to take any point.</p>



<p>City do score a lot of goals and trust Guardiola to stick with his system of trying to overload the Foxes with wave after wave of attacks. However, this is one of Man City&#8217;s toughest fixtures. Last seasons game proves it. Club legend Kompany had to produce a strike from the gods to beat Leicester and secure the title. So this game should be a cracker for the neutrals.</p>

<ul><li>Both clubs secured a win in preparation for the clash</li><li>This game is more than 3 points. Who will make more noise on Saturday night?</li></ul>



<p>Conventional thinking sees this game is one-sided and easy to call, ‘Of course Guardiola’s men are better than their rivals! Easy win for the Citizens.’ But this could not be farther from the truth. Anything can happen in a Manchester Derby.</p>



<p>Just when you think United are on the ropes, they come up with an unexpected haymaker. The match (at 19:30 CAT) comes before the Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr II fight, so we’ll be glued to our TVs for a while. Who will claim bragging rights in the biggest game of the season? </p>



<p>It never fails to live up to expectations, and rarely produces draws. The last four matches have averaged 3.5 goals, so most are expecting goals. Guardiola’s men are fresh from a 4-1 victory at Burnley and are looking to maintain momentum to catch up to league leaders Liverpool. While Solskjaer’s United are looking to build on the confidence after beating Spurs on Wednesday night. Neither look impressive at the back, in fact, they record 0 clean sheets in their last 5 games.</p>

Manchester Evening News</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The Champions are Fired Up</h2>



<p>The Citizens secured a vital win against Burnley after failing to beat Newcastle. There’s a sense that the title belongs to Liverpool, not only because of City’s setbacks (injuries, VAR decisions, shady defending), but because the Reds seem to be dancing their way to glory. This will motivate Pep and his men more than anything else.</p>



<p>The game is at the Etihad stadium, and the Citizens have scored a crazy 43 goals in 15 games. So everyone will be expecting goals from the Home side. Be careful though, the Sky Blues are without legend Aguero who has 8 goals in 11 games in this fixture. Sterling, De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus will have to step up. Jesus is expected to fill the boots of Aguero and write his name in the history books. With the ridiculous support structure behind him, the Brazilian will be looking to score tomorrow.</p>



<p>City look very unsettled in defence without key man Laporte. Although Fernandinho is trying, he is not a natural defender and is prone to errors that lead to costly set-pieces in dangerous areas. Pep has been looking to rectify that, insisting that the Brazilian is his main man in defence right now. Indeed, they almost kept a clean sheet against Burnley but a lapse in concentration in the 89<sup>th</sup> minute meant they conceded again!</p>



<h2>Momentum Breeds Confidence- United Feeling Good
Again</h2>



<p>Solskjaer summed up his team&#8217;s mood right now when he said ‘Confidence is a strange thing in football, you can get a performance and a result like Wednesday night and it boosts it so much and I know our boys will be up for it.’ </p>



<p>He didn’t stop there, he took a sly dig at the noisy neighbours about the derby saying <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/man-utd-boss-solskjaer-aims-cheeky-derby-dig-at-city-at-least-we-/1ntx1z47mfe001hc2i9mve41al">‘At least we play every year now.</a>’ Reminding Man City followers of their poor history (It wasn’t too long ago City were competing in League One).</p>



<p>Man
United are 6<sup>th</sup> in the league and 8 points from Chelsea and the final
CL spot, so will be looking for a win here.</p>



<p>Marcus Rashford is leading United’s resurgence, and is a goal away from his record 10 in a full PL season. <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/big-match-preview-man-utd-vs-tottenham-gw15/">We mentioned he would be the decider on Wednesday night</a> and he did not disappoint.  As a local lad he knows what this Derby means, so there’s no doubt he will be the one to watch out for as he relishes big games like these.</p>



<p>On the other hand, United’s defence is shaky to say the least. They have conceded in each of their last 10 games, which comes as a surprise as their fans claim to have the best goalkeeper in the world. They possibly have their best back four available, but haven’t look convincing all season. </p>



<h2>Team News and Likely Line-up</h2>



<p>In terms of injuries, City are without Laporte, Sane, Aguero, and Zinchenko. The Citizens will play their usual 4-3-3 formation, with high octane fluid football- taking the game to united. They will look for an early goal to break United’s resolve and force Solskjaer to change his tactics. City&#8217;s defence needs repair as they look to cut off Rashford’s supply line. If they cannot put the brakes on Rashford and James they might be in for trouble. This is the expected line-up.</p>

<p>As for Man Utd, they are without Rojo, Bailly, Dalot, Matic, and Pogba. Martial is a doubt but should be in contention. The Red Devils will likely employ a 3-4-3 formation with a low block, to limit the spaces for City wingers. They are likely going to try and hit City on the counter through the flanks. The game plan will be to try to contain a City onslaught and take advantage of their adventurous wingbacks when they are out of position. This is the expected line up for the Red Devils.</p>
