rang around the Friends Arena in tribute to those who died and were injured in the attack which cast a shadow over this showpiece occasion.<\/p>\n<p>Mourinho &#8211; who has so often looked so unhappy this season &#8211; ran on to the field to celebrate with his players and was thrown in the air by his coaching staff and hugged by his son.<\/p>\n<p>It means United are now the fifth team to claim the full quota of European trophies, joining an illustrious list with Ajax, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">Mourinho back in the old routine<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__body media\">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__image gel-responsive-image\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes sp-lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 976w\" alt=\"Jose Mourinho\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/23F0\/production\/_96200290_mou_four_getty.jpg 976w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">Jose Mourinho has now won four major European trophies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Mourinho has had his moments of frustration this season &#8211; especially with 15 Premier League draws that led to an unsatisfactory sixth-place finish.<\/p>\n<p>It left United&#8217;s Champions League hopes resting on this game but the win and subsequent qualification for the group stages of Europe&#8217;s elite tournament means that Mourinho can regard this season as a real success.<\/p>\n<p>Some may question the quality of United&#8217;s performances and this undoubtedly remains a work in progress but two trophies and that place back in the Champions League is an impressive outcome, irrespective of the style in which it was achieved.<\/p>\n<p>It was also a European final won without key defender Eric Bailly, who was suspended, and 28-goal leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who sustained a serious knee injury in the quarter-final win against Anderlecht at Old Trafford.<\/p>\n<p>Tottenham&#8217;s Mauricio Pochettino and Liverpool&#8217;s Jurgen Klopp have received much praise for their work this season and getting into next season&#8217;s Champions League &#8211; Mourinho has done that and added the actual tangible reward of two pieces of silverware on top.<\/p>\n<p>Mourinho&#8217;s mood has often been dark this season but he still has that habit of dealing in his favourite currency, namely trophies.<\/p>\n<p>And the result means United can, finally, regard their season as a successful one as a night which started with a mixture of silence then applause for those who died in Monday&#8217;s attack and ended with Wayne Rooney lifting the Europa League trophy on what is very likely to be his final appearance for the club.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">Pogba shows his class<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__body media\">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__image gel-responsive-image\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes sp-lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 976w\" alt=\"Paul Pogba (bottom right) celebrates scoring the opening goal\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/F22F\/production\/_96199916_pogba2.jpg 976w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">Paul Pogba scored his ninth goal of the season<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Pogba has struggled to justify the world-record transfer fee of \u00a389m paid to Juventus last summer but this was a stage on which he showed flashes of the qualities that persuaded Mourinho to make him such a high-priority signing.<\/p>\n<p>Like this United side, there is still much to do before he can be regarded as the finished article but the manner in which he made sure early midfield dominance was secured was impressive and he added a goal for good measure.<\/p>\n<p>It may end up being classed as an own goal but Pogba will happily accept it, trying his luck from 20 yards after being afforded just a little too much space by Ajax captain Davy Klaassen and helped by a huge deflection off Davinson Sanchez. And perhaps he was due that touch of good fortune after being thwarted by the woodwork so often this season.<\/p>\n<p>And it was another profitable night for another big-money Mourinho buy, Mkhitaryan. The Armenian struggled in the first half but showed what a priceless poacher&#8217;s instinct he has, swooping from close range for another Europa League goal.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\">Ajax youngsters suffer stage fright<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"sp-media-asset \">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__body media\">\n<div class=\"sp-media-asset__image gel-responsive-image\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes sp-lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 976w\" alt=\"Ajax players\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/240\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 240w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/320\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 320w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/480\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 480w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 624w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/800\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 800w, http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/onesport\/cps\/976\/cpsprodpb\/13D94\/production\/_96200318_ajax_afp.jpg 976w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"sp-media-asset__caption gel-brevier \">Ajax were appearing in their first European final since 1996<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ajax coach Peter Bosz said it would be understandable for his young side to feel nervous &#8211; and his fears were confirmed as they were never able to show off the full extent of their glittering promise.<\/p>\n<p>Six of the starting line-up were 21 or under in the youngest 11 to start a major European final, with an average age of 22 years and 280 days.
