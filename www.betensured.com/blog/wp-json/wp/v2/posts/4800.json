The make-up of most of these fantasy sports is similar. You will have to form your own team and the player performances will either increase or decrease your points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The winner of the fantasy betting is determined by\nthe total points accrued. These points come from played performances in actual\nreal-life games. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an offshoot of fantasy betting called daily\nfantasy sport (DFS). Unlike the fantasy betting where you have to wait for\nreal-life games to get points, daily fantasy betting on sports allows you to\nstake daily on the performances of players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the FSTA, fantasy betting generated\naround 7 billion dollars in total revenue in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Fantasy Betting Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be wondering how to go about playing fantasy betting, look no further.

Fantasy betting is just football: While football\nbetting is more popular than all betting, it is entirely false that you can play\nfantasy betting on only football. There are several sports that you can play\nfootball betting on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Fantasy betting is recreational and cannot be profitable:\nThis is another false notion. Fantasy betting can both be fun and\nmoney-spinning. You just have to register with the necessary fantasy betting\nsite to make money. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Top <strong>Fantasy Betting Sites<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are specific sites where you can register and play a fantasy bet. They include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fantasydraft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fantasy Draft (opens in a new tab)\">Fantasy Draft<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanduel.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fan Duel (opens in a new tab)\">Fan Duel<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynumber.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Daily Number  (opens in a new tab)\">Daily Number <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.draftpot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Draft Pot (opens in a new tab)\">Draft Pot<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monkeyknifefight.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Monkey Knife Fight (opens in a new tab)\">Monkey Knife Fight<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betway.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Betway  (opens in a new tab)\">Betway <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 <strong>Things To Consider Before Joining A Fantasy Betting Site <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Reputation<\/strong>: A fantasy betting site should have a good reputation before considering doing business with them. Reputation is everything in the business. So you shouldn&#8217;t get entangled with a betting site with financial scandals; some of which may be, late payment of winnings and slow payouts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Liquidity:<\/strong> You must be sure that the fantasy betting site you use has a huge financial war chest. If a betting site does not have a good liquidity ratio, they may not pay your winnings if it is too much for them. A good business should have a sustainable capital base. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>The number of active customers<\/strong>: Fantasy betting needs lots of active players to thrive. Therefore, a good fantasy betting must have huge active customers to make playing with one another easy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Customer service<\/strong>: You must consider how the fantasy betting site relates to its customers and the speed at which they solve issues. Good customer care is needed to tie loose ends and resolve complaints. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>A user-friendly platform<\/strong>: The fantasy betting site must be one that is easy to use and very navigate, even for amateurs. It shouldn&#8217;t be complicated or slow. The site must also have various options to make an informed choice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Many <strong>Pros Of Fantasy Betting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. It is a great avenue to make new friends and keep\nin touch with old ones. Fantasy betting encourages togetherness and\nsocializing. You can&#8217;t be bored or lonely playing fantasy betting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. It consumes less time especially if you engage in\nDaily Fantasy Sport. Unlike most traditional types of betting that can take up\nto hours or days, with DFS, you see the result within hours. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Unlike traditional betting that can only be\nplayed by players who are 18+ and not legal in all countries. Fantasy betting\nis allowed for all and has very few legal restrictions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unavoidable <strong>Cons Of Fantasy Betting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. No matter how we look at it, it is still a form\nof gambling which may lead to addiction. Addiction can cause mental illness and\nfinancial loss. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. It is not free. The fantasy betting site charges\na commission for their services. For instance, if you enter a contest and stake\n$200, you will have to pay 10% of your stake, which means you will be parting\nwith $220.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The chances of winning are very slim. This is\nbecause most fans do not put enough time in strategic planning and research. Also,\nthere are lots of unforeseen circumstances that can let you get point deduction.\nNo one plans to get sent off or loses penalty, these things just happen. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Best <strong>Bet Types Available On Fantasy Betting <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy betting has various options that a bettor\ncan play. Below are the more popular options;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Prize pool leagues:<\/strong> Here, players pay a fee to contest in a league to win a fixed amount. In this option, players will be paid depending on the position they finish on the league table. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Head-to-head contest<\/strong>: This option allows a player to contest against another player to win a unified prize. Some fantasy bettors believe that contesting against one player increases their chances of winning the prize. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>50\/50 chance<\/strong>: Larger leagues allow this type of option. 50\/50 chance gives all players that end up at the top half of the table double their stake, while players at the lower half of the table end up with nothing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Fantasy cash games<\/strong>: You join a custom-made league where the better side gets a financial reward. However, the reward given is little compared to what the other options offer. But this option is slightly easier to understand and win than other options. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Differences Between Fantasy Betting And Traditional System Of Betting. <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Fantasy betting can sometimes be free, especially\nif you are an amateur and just testing the ropes to get more understanding.\nHowever, with traditional betting you cannot test anything; you will need to stake\nwith cash. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Fantasy sports betting is not gambling, it is a skill and a game. However, with the traditional betting, it is all about luck, it is 99%, chance, and 1% research. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. With traditional betting, there are a plethora of market options that are unavailable in a fantasy sport. In Betfair, for example, there are around 98 soccer options while there are just around four to five options in fantasy betting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. The absence of commission in traditional betting\nmakes it cost-friendlier than fantasy bet. In traditional betting, your stake\nis multiplied by odds to give you your total prize money. But a commission is\ndeducted by the fantasy betting site if you wish to win any prize money. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conclusion <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy betting is an option of betting, where you\nare given the power to assemble your team and earn points on your players&#8217;\nperformance. You can play fantasy betting against one player or several players\nat once. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy betting sites charge a minimum commission of\n5% on all your fantasy bets. Although this commission varies on sports and with\nseveral fantasy sites. Your total prize money depends on your starting\ninvestment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article has been able to show you how fantasy betting works, several betting sites that you can play the sport on, and the differences between fantasy betting and the traditional mode of betting. The contentious issue of fantasy betting legality has also be trashed, while most countries agree it is some sort of skill, it is illegal in some states in the US and Canada. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy betting is fun, skillful, and can make you a profit with appropriate training and research. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the success of traditional sports business and the amount of financial revenue it generates, efforts have been made to find an alternative system of betting.
