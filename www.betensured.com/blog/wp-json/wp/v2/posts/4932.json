As the second tier competition, it does not have the\nsame prestige attached to it as the Champions League, which is widely regarded\nas the best club competition in the world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But does the Europa League offer things\nthat make it fascinating, and actually the most interesting football\ncompetition to bet on? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many factors to think about when\nwagering on football. If you are betting on ante post markets, then there is\neven more to think about. However, when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newbettingsites.uk\/\">betting<\/a> on Europa League football,\nsome of these are complete unknowns until later in the year, all due to how the\ncompetition works. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Factors Make the Europa League Unique?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and most obvious factor is that\nteams can move from the Champions League into the Europa League after the group\nstage of both competitions has been placed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a list of teams who have qualified\nfor the Europa League group stage, including big clubs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arsenal.com\/\">Arsenal<\/a> and Tottenham from England. We also\nknow the qualification teams, who are trying to get into the group stages,\nthese are usually smaller clubs in the competition. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the teams who finish 3<sup>rd<\/sup>\nin the Champions League group stage will be added to the Europa League at a\nlater date, we won\u2019t know those until the group games have been played. These\ncould be smaller teams, who won\u2019t impact the Europa League too much, or they\ncould be huge clubs, some of the biggest in Europe. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add teams such as Bayern Munich, Real\nMadrid and Juventus into the Europa League if they were to disappoint in the\nChampions League and they would instantly become tournament favourites. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adds something completely different\nfrom a betting perspective too, whether you make your own selections or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/pricing\/\">follow football betting tips<\/a>,\nthe Europa League format certainly makes it difficult. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second factor that makes this\ncompetition unique is that many teams do not play their best eleven, giving\nplayers a rest ahead of their domestic fixtures at the weekend. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are comparing teams ahead of a\ngame, you can usually compare their best eleven because this is who will play,\nassuming all players are fit and available. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the Europa League that is not\nalways the case. Many of the bigger clubs rest players and this is usually not\nknown until the team news comes out. For those placing their bets before this\nhappens, working out who may or may not play is another element you need to\nfactor into your bets on this competition that you don\u2019t elsewhere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Europa League gets quite a raw deal in\nterms of stature and the prestige attached to winning the competition. However,\nwhen it comes to betting, this competition offers a very unique challenge and\nfor that reason, we believe it to be the most interesting European football\ncompetition,<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is the Europa League the Most Interesting European Football Competition?
