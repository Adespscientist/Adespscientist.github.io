Since then, 16 states have passed\nlegislation regulating betting, most of them covering online betting as well,\nand several others are planning to do so this year. And these plans aren\u2019t held\nback by the disappearance of live sports from most countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colorado goes live<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorado citizens saw four sportsbooks open\ntheir (virtual) gates this May, amid a painful lack of sports to bet on, with\ntwo more that didn\u2019t go live on the same day. The lack of live sports was\ncompensated by a variety of eSports betting options available across the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorado\u2019s betting market is expected to be\nvery competitive, with 17 of the 33 available \u201cskins\u201d (for the state\u2019s 33 legal\ngambling operators) \u201csold\u201d, and several out-of-state operators expressing\ninterest in joint ventures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Jersey approves new sports<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of live sports has prompted New\nJersey\u2019s Division of Gaming Enforcement to expand the number of overseas sports\nlocals can bet on. With a lack of live sports in the US, sports like Algerian\nsoccer, Turkish volleyball, and Swedish handball have shown up among the\nbetting options available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limited eSports betting was already available\nin the state but the state\u2019s legislators now consider expanding it to cover all\neSports events not involving high schools and underage participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tennessee adopts an open\nlicensing system<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, the Tennessee Education Lottery\nBoard has approved regulations for when sports betting will become legal in the\nstate (most likely, by the end of 2020). The state has adopted an open\nlicensing system, similar to what European and international operators like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betway.co.zm\/sport\/soccer\">Betway<\/a>\nare subjected to, with an unlimited number of licenses available. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online and mobile betting operators will be\nable to offer bets on professional sports, college sports and most Olympic\nsports, with no word on virtual and eSports yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nevada embraces eSports, too<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In late March, the Nevada Gaming Control Board\nhas introduced new regulations covering, among others, eSports betting options\non events like the 2020 Overwatch League, various League of Legends tournaments,\nand the eNASCAR series, among others. There are, in turn, some age-related\nrestrictions that they have to observe: betting is not allowed on events\ninvolving high schools or where the majority of the contestants are under 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the utter lack of live sports, the sports betting industry continues to develop across the United States. And when things return to normal, its growth is expected to speed up considerably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start winning football bets now.
