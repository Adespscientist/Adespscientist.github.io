Many believe betting\non live matches is better, some believe certain sports (for instance, football,\ntennis, basketball etc.) will bring more gain, but some see their gains in\nvirtual football. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some will argue that if winning on real soccer games\nare hard, how then do you win with programmed virtual soccer? The answer is not\nfar-fetched. It is simply using skill, perseverance and tact. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will delve into the world of virtual football betting today and all you need to know about virtual soccer betting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What\nis virtual football betting?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every bookie is constantly on the lookout for new\navenues to make customers and clients key into the different ways of betting\nand of course, offering something different from the conventional betting.\nVirtual football betting is a stimulated football game that offers all that conventional\nfootball has and even much more. Virtual football is a programmed game created\nwith codes and algorithms made to entertain customers and bettors and offer\nthem an immediate avenue to make a profit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind virtual football betting is to\nlessen the time customers spend waiting for the actual football games to end,\nwhile offering them the opportunity to make quick money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In virtual football betting, different leagues are\nintroduced, ranging from the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga and\nthe Italia Seria A. You are also shown the team table which contains the form\nand statistics of each team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The time interval between each game ending is usually\nbetween three to five minutes. What this implies is that within three to five\nminutes, you will know the result of your stake. The results from each event\nare generated by a computer algorithm which picks the winner fairly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, games are played at all hours of the day (24\/7),\nevery day for users wishing to stake on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bettors stake on the eventual outcome of their\nchosen football teams by looking at the odds offered, the stimulated histories\nand player profiles that are provided by the bookie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How is virtual football programmed?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual football is programmed to mirror how exactly\nreal football matches are played. A group of programmers and computer\nspecialists are employed to study real-life football leagues and make a\ncomputerised version of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this entails is that the strongest team in\nreal-life; the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City, PSG and\nJuventus will still be very strong while the likes of Norwich, Aston Villa, Villareal,\nand Osasuna amongst others will still be weak. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you have to be very careful with this line\nof thought. There are usually upsets in real life; therefore there will also be\nupsets in the virtual matches. There are no guarantees that the big boys will\nalways win and that is how the programming works as well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not know which week upsets are coming; you\nhave to play the game regularly to guarantee better wins. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, the table and form charts are valuable,\nhowever, they mean very little to what can happen in the actual game. A team\nmight win five straight matches and suddenly lose to the 19<sup>th<\/sup> placed\nteam. Virtual games are programmed to keep the customers coming back for more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages\nof virtual football betting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. A pivotal benefit of virtual football betting is\nthat it is always available. A 24\/7 stimulated game will always be available\nfor you to stake on. Therefore, there is no waiting for match day anymore. Just\nstake and bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Another huge benefit virtual football has is that\nthe matches are usually shorter in duration. You don\u2019t have to wait for so long\nto know the outcome of an event. Although the duration varies from one bookie\nto another, on an average, it is between three to five minutes on all\nstimulated virtual matches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. It is very easy to learn and play. Even people with\nlittle or no knowledge of football can stake, as long as they understand the\nrudiments of betting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Some problems associated with real football matches\nare eliminated in virtual football betting. Problems like an injury to key players,\npoor weather conditions, a wrong decision by the referee and late substitution\nare all inexistent in virtual football.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. There are also fewer markets available in virtual\nbetting than real matches, which leads to less confusion for customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. You have the opportunity to make an immediate\nprofit and solve issues<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages\nof virtual soccer betting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like every other entity; virtual soccer betting\nalso has its drawbacks. Some of which are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. It can become an addiction: It is common to hear\nstories of bettors who are addicted to virtual betting. And like everything\nthat causes addiction, it affects an individual negatively. Addiction to\nvirtual betting creates a pseudo winning mentality on the punter which makes\nhim think he can always get his money back if he continues to gamble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Promotes joblessness and encourages social vices:\nPlaying virtual betting usually prevents people from having a stable job and also\naffects their productivity and performance at work. All a bettor will think of\nis that he can make more money from virtual betting than through hard work.\nAlso virtual may encourage an individual to steal when he has lost a lot of\nmoney.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Virtual football betting removes the thrill that\nreal soccer gives because the output giving is false and without excitement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Virtual soccer betting always has one outcome; an\neventual loss to the punter who doesn\u2019t give up. The game is so programmed that\nno matter how the bettor plays, he will eventually lose. Don\u2019t forget the axiom\nof betting that says \u201cthe house always wins\u201d? This applies to virtual soccer as\nwell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Leads to extreme poverty and indebtedness:\nVirtual soccer betting, when one is addicted, can ultimately lead to one\ngetting indebted and becoming poor, especially the majority of gamblers who\nhave become addicted to this type of game. Many have been pushed to borrow\nmoney with the hope that they will reap profit immediately but unfortunately,\nthey end up losing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The differences between virtual soccer betting and real soccer betting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. In real football matches, there are a plethora of\nmarkets and possibilities that can happen in an event. In real matches, you\ncould have up to seven to eight goals. However, in virtual soccer matches, all\nthings are programmed. Specifically, all goals in virtual soccer are fixed at six;\nmeaning, you can only have a score line like 1-0, 1-1, 2-1, 3-3, 3-2, 1-5, 6-0,\netc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Also, in virtual soccer betting, the numbers of\nthings you can stake on are very limited, unlike the real soccer betting that\nyou can have handicap betting, corner, the number of fouls, half-time\nsubstitution and the likes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The quality of players in both virtual football\nand real soccer betting is very different. In real life betting, the coach is\nseen and can make necessary substitutions when there is the need for one,\nunlike the virtual soccer that no yellow card, no red card, the play itself is\ndrab and no formation is displayed.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. In real football betting, you have more\ninformation to work with and bet with, unlike the virtual football betting\nwhere there exist only false statistics displayed, which doesn\u2019t determine the\nactual possibility of the team you wish to stake on. In real football, you can deduce\nthat a star player is injured, a team does not really need the match, their\nform has dropped; all these are not available in the virtual soccer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. In real football betting, you have to wait the entire\nninety minutes that it takes for the football match to end before you know your\nfate and can decide if the bet wins or not.&nbsp;\nHowever, in virtual betting, you will win or lose within 3 to 5 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Not all bookmakers offer virtual football,\nhowever, bookmakers offer real football betting on their platform, the reason\nbehind this is because not every bookmaker is interested in stimulated matches\nand some believe it is not as profitable as real football betting<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Top\nvirtual football bookies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the bookmakers that offer virtual football\nbetting include but are not limited to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bet365.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.bet365.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.bet365.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betfair.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.betfair.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.betfair.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betvictor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.betvictor.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.betvictor.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betfred.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.betfred.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.betfred.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.williamhill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.williamhill.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.williamhill.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betking.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.betking.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.betking.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.coral.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.coral.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paddypower.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.paddypower.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.paddypower.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bet9ja.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"www.bet9ja.com (opens in a new tab)\">www.bet9ja.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to win virtual football betting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Make sure you learn the rudiments<\/strong>: Virtual soccer betting does not need you to have the basic knowledge of real soccer, however, you need to learn how to play the stimulated game if you really want to win enough money in it. Like all games, there are certain tricks and tips which you need to learn. This learning process takes time and can only be done by watching people play the game over a period of time. Study the game well and you will get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>After studying the rudiments of virtual soccer bettin<\/strong>g, you will need to start betting with small amounts. This is what is called testing the waters in gambling. Money is not easy to come by; therefore you need to start small before delving fully into virtual soccer betting. Virtual soccer is programmed to give you the impression of real soccer; however, these realities are false. That is why starting small is important; it helps reduce your losses. Although staking with little money means you will also win little, however, against the computer, any win is a win. The key is making a profit, no matter the amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Stop chasing your losses<\/strong>: If a punter really wants to win virtual soccer betting, he has to stop chasing his losses. He has to know to chill and take a back seat. You are playing against a computer created by several top-rated computer specialists and programmers; you don\u2019t expect to win every time. Therefore, it is advisable for punters to choose their battles wisely and sometimes accept defeat. If you do not stop chasing your losses, the probability of you losing heavily is very high. Chasing your losses in virtual football betting usually result to even more losses. The best way is to stay back after a loss, think through your loss and strategize on how to bounce back strongly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Target a particular market you have studied well<\/strong>: After a series of losses, take a back seat and study the type of markets that you can make a profit from. After you have done this, make sure you stick to only that particular market you have mastered to make an optimum profit from it. It has been discovered that people who stick to a particular virtual betting strategy make more profit from virtual football betting than people who play many markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Always back the favourite teams<\/strong>: In as much as virtual soccer betting is programmed on randomness and unpredictability, it has been noted that the big teams rarely lose. It will, therefore, be wise and profitable for a punter interested in virtual betting to always stick to the favourites. Although always backing favourites will rarely make you very rich, it will greatly reduce your losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>Take any win<\/strong>: You have to note that playing virtual football betting stakes you against a programmed computer that is programmed for you to lose, therefore if you, by any chance, get a small profit, please walk away. Any win against virtual should be celebrated because virtual football won\u2019t always favour you; it is so programmed that you can only win at most 20%. Therefore, if at any time of the day you manage to beat the system, celebrate and move on instead of falling into the temptation of wanting more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. <strong>Always change your strategy<\/strong>: The creators of virtual football betting always upgrade their system at least twice in a month; it is, therefore, not advisable to keep using one particular system because you have won money with it. You have to constantly change your game patterns to match your winnings. You may stick with a market but you can change your game. For example, if you have won with over 2.5 goals market before, you could switch to under 2.5 goals. This is because the system will not always favour the goals market every week. Therefore, you have to learn to beat the bookies at their game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual football betting is an interesting venture to delve in, however, you have to be careful not to be sucked into it and incur heavy losses. Virtual football betting is an interesting avenue to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/win-at-sports-betting-6-tips-to-help-you-make-money-with-sports-betting\/\">make more money in betting<\/a>, but you need to learn the tricks, strategies and ways to make it your preferred way to make a profit.
