Games will not be played around India as normal, instead three venues will host the entire season, all of which are in the state of Goa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All games will be played behind closed doors for the entire season, no spectators will be allowed to attend. Things are going to be different, fans will have to watch from home and teams are going to have to adapt to a new way of playing, all of which makes this a very intriguing new season to look forward to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2020\/21 Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This season sees the league move up to 11 teams with the inclusion of East Bengal, who have joined as an expansion team. It will be very interesting to see how they fare in their first season in the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiansuperleague.com\/\"> Indian Super League<\/a>, can they get their act together and challenge the front runners, or will they struggle?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up at the top of the table, league winners Goa last season will be looking to replicate that, though their performance in the playoffs is something they will be looking to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The playoffs were won by ATK, their third title and they are the first ISL team to win three titles. Their dominance has not gone unnoticed and the<a href=\"https:\/\/betfromindia.com\/betting-sites\/\"> sports betting sites<\/a> for customers in India are likely to make them favourites to lift the title once again this season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team to mention in the title race is Bengaluru, they finished third in the regular season and were beaten in the playoff semi finals by eventual winners ATK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down at the bottom of the table, Hyderabad and NorthEast United both won just two games all season and they are expected to struggle again after few changes during the off season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, having said all of that, this is not going to be a regular ISL season, things are going to be very different and for that reason, teams will need more than just skill to win games. This will no doubt make things tough for<a href=\"http:\/\/www.betensured.com\/\"> football tipsters<\/a> who are looking to predict results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who adapt to conditions both the quickest and the best will likely fare well, and for that reason we could see some surprises in the games, rather than the usual faces dominating things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is incredibly disappointing for fans who usually attend that they will not be able to watch the games live from the stadium this year, it does add some intrigue to the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things are certainly going to be different, but one positive is that a full season plan has been put in place, rather than the uncertainty of things changing throughout the season and the ISL should be applauded for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans will be pleased to see football of any kind taking place in India, even if it isn\u2019t what we are used to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Indian Super League will take place this year, though the 2020\/21 season will be very different to anything we have seen before, and likely anything we will ever see again.
