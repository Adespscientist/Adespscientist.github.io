The final- versus Atletico Madrid-\nwas not a great spectacle up until the last few minutes in extra-time when\nAlvaro Morata was clean on goal and Valverde \u2018took one for the team\u2019. The\nresult is more impressive when you realise that Real Madrid were without Karim\nBenzema and Gareth Bale. Another trophy for Zinedine Zidane. Nine out of nine\nfinals won now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Atletico Madrid especially under Diego\nSimeone, they would give any team a run for their money but cannot seem to\nfinish teams when chanced. Joao Felix had a chance early on and snatched at it,\nAlvaro Morata also had a chance but hit a very tame effort to the in-form\nCourtois. When you bear in mind that they play Liverpool in Champions League\nnext month, you wonder if they stand any chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Paris St. Germain held by Monaco..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game itself would ultimately most\nlikely be inconsequential- I mean that PSG would win the League eventually, in\ncase you do not understand- but Monaco put up a good fight, having to come from\nbehind twice. For PSG, the Holy Grail is still the Champions League (they would\nbe happy that they have a fit and happy Neymar this time, fingers crossed) but\nwinning the Ligue 1 would still be the barest minimum achievable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Liverpool cannot be stopped..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most neutrals were looking forward to this\ngame &#8211; you know, Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers, clowns, Jose Mourinho, Chelsea,\nthe Gerrard slip, etcetera? However, Liverpool was in control of this game save\nfor the last 20 minutes following the inclusion of Lo Celso and Lamela.\nUltimately, over the course of 90 minutes, Liverpool deserved the win. This\ntime, Firmino was the man with the solitary goal. Liverpool has now gone 38\ngames unbeaten- albeit in two different seasons- dropping only two points away\nto Manchester United. Next up for the Reds: Manchester United. Let us see the\nversion of Manchester United that Solskjaer serves up for the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Serie A is the League to watch\nthis season..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is because Antonio Conte is\ndoing wonders with Inter Milan or Maurizio Sarri is still having some\ndifficulty in determining his best way to play in Juventus or the magic that\nSimone Inzaghi is performing with Lazio, the Serie A is the League that may go\nto the wire this season. Over the weekend, Inter Milan hosted a very good\nAtalanta side and were held to a draw. Inter Milan did not deserve to win it as\nthey were poor especially in the second half. Juventus went away to Roma and\nduly took advantage, although they also did not have a good second half after\nbeing two goals up very early in the game. The lead is now two points. If Lazio\nwins their game in hand which is highly possible considering their blistering\nform, they would be a point behind second placed Inter Milan. Juventus cannot\nafford to look down.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Real Madrid win yet another trophy..
