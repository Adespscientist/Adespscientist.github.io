It is hardly surprising that football attracts such staggering\nviewership as matches take place almost on a daily basis, thus providing\ngambling enthusiasts with a nearly endless range of betting markets to select\nfrom. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from being hugely entertaining, wagering\non football can turn out to be profit-making, given that punters are put on the\nright track. One of the ways to get closer to the profit they are after is to\nstick to the most lucrative betting markets football offers. So, if you are\nkeen to learn more about this topic, just keep on reading. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Are the Most Profitable Football Betting Markets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been to a brick-and-mortar\nbookmaker at least once, perhaps, you have noticed that there are punters that\nare overly confident in their knowledge about football, but in practice, the\nwins they are eager to bag slip through their fingers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, this happens due to the fact\nthat the decisions gambling aficionados make in terms of which team to bet on\nare based predominantly on the football-related news we are all flooded with\nfrom media.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most essential things gambling\nenthusiasts should be aware of is that if certain information about a team or\nplayer has already hit the headlines, the odds that are offered for that market\nwill be adapted right away. What this means is that if punters want to make\nsure that they will be able to win consistently, they need to learn how to\ninterpret the minutest details. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Correct Score<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Punters who are intrigued by wagering on\nfootball and are looking to guarantee themselves a long-term success should\nconsider betting on the correct score of the match. The name of this way of\nbetting on the sport is pretty much self-explanatory due to the fact that\nwagering on this market is all about predicting the final score of the chosen\nfootball match. If punters have made a correct pick, they will get the respective\npayoff. What punters need to make up their mind about is whether the home or\naway team will win or if the match will end in a draw or a tie. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of the fact that most of the time,\nthese markets tend to offer some truly alluring odds, football bettors should\nbe mindful that telling for sure what the final score will be can be rather\nchallenging because of the unpredictability of the game. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Double Chance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this market does not offer that\nadvantageous odds, especially in comparison with the above-mentioned one, many\nlovers of football betting prefer it because, in practice, it allows them to\nbet on two out of the three possible outcomes of a match. The reason why the\nvalue of the odds is significantly reduced is that the likelihood of making a\ncorrect prediction is much bigger. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, such markets can turn out to\nbe exceptionally profitable, provided that punters pick the matches smartly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For beginners, when you opt for betting on\nthis football market, you will be allowed to decide if you wish to make a stake\non the away team and a draw or the home team and a draw. Additionally, the\noption to lay your wager on both teams to win is also an alternative. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Draw No Bet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The draw no bet is one more football betting\nmarket that is hugely preferred by punters due to the fact that when they opt\nfor it, the draw is eliminated as a possible outcome. This means that even if\nthe match ends in a tie, gambling enthusiasts will simply have the staked\namount returned to their bankroll. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Half Time Results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bets of this nature are immensely popular\namong punters due to the fact that they allow for wagering on the score of the\nfirst half of the football match. What is worth mentioning is that when you opt\nfor such a wager, the final result of the match will be irrelevant for your\nbet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This market allows football fans to lay a\nwager on the team they think will be losing or winning once the first 45\nminutes of the match have elapsed. With this market, betting on a draw is an\noption as well. This market can turn out to be profitable if punters manage to\nfind increased odds, which is the case when the value of the odds is higher\nthan those offered when they opt for an ordinary win bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Over\/Under 2.5 Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While being on the lookout for some of the\nmost lucrative football betting markets, you should certainly pay attention to\nthe over\/under 2.5 market. When gambling aficionados opt for this betting\nmarket, they wager that the total number of goals that will be scored\nthroughout the course of the match will be less or more than 2.5. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, the value of the odds for\nsuch markets will be somewhere between 1.2 and 2.5, and such a noticeable\ndifference is most likely to be found in matches between rather high-scoring\nteams. This is possible also when the competing teams are defensive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding value with such markets is unlikely to\nturn out to be that challenging due to the fact that even if you are not able\nto say for sure which of the teams will win the game, you might still be able\nto predict how many goals might be scored. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Things to Consider<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The betting markets punters can select from\nare plentiful, and other common options include wagering on the first\ngoalscorer, the number of corners, yellow and red cards, and so on. What\ngambling aficionados should not forget is that they can also combine multiple\nselections in a single wager, which is possible when they go for an accumulator\nbet. Before you opt for such bets, just make sure that you have first had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportingpedia.com\/football-betting\/accumulators-explained\/\">football\naccumulators explained<\/a> properly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to enjoy a profitable\nfootball betting session, the available markets are not the only thing you\nshould focus your attention on. Gambling enthusiasts should not underrate the\nrole bankroll management plays. Punters should make sure that they will not\nattempt to chase their losses and that they will not bet too much. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, they should also give thought to\nthe size of their individual stakes so as to ensure that their bankroll will\nlast longer, and they will not put all money they have prepared for their\nbetting session on a stake or two. In addition to this, punters are advised to\nread up on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportingpedia.com\/football-betting\/football-value-betting\/\">what\nvalue betting is<\/a> as once they master it, they will be able to get\nbetter rewards consistently and on a regular basis. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to the profusion of betting opportunities sports provide, there are no two ways about it that football is hard to beat.
