<p>Do you bet online on sport? What sports do you bet on the most?</p>



<p>Any passionate bettor should know that betting has had quite the evolution, going from roadside kiosks handled by one bookmaker with his really big book, to an integrated website where you can bet on a variety of sports complete with really cool features like customer support, betting tips, better security, strategies and easy access to betting sites via the use of your mobile phone, computer or laptop.</p>



<p>Betting has evolved, and Betensured wanted to know just how much people&#8217;s attitude towards it had changed as well, so we conducted a survey on the pulse of gambling to see how people in Nigeria bet.</p>



<p>During our online betting survey, we focused on areas such as:</p>



<ul><li>Which Gender Bets More</li><li>Which Age Range Bets The Most</li><li>Why Do People Bet?</li><li>Where People Place Their Bets</li><li>Favorite Football Market</li><li>Favourite Sports Market</li><li>Favourite League To Bet On</li><li>How Many Odds Bettors Bet On</li><li>How Many Betting Sites People Use</li></ul>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>During our survey, we found that:</p>



<p><strong>1:  Men Bets More Than Women</strong></p>



<p>Our survey reveals that we have more men using online sites to bet more than women. In a similar survey we took in 2019, men still gambled more than women.</p>



<p>This may be due to the fact that men are usually more passionate about sports and are generally more likely to take risks betting on sports.</p>



<p><strong>2: Age Group</strong></p>



<p>From the survey, we noticed that the age group that bet the most, were between the ages of 25-31, making up 33.69% of the bettors.</p>



<p>This shows that online betting is more prominent amongst people in their early twenties and thirties.</p>



<p><strong>3: Why People Bet</strong></p>



<p>When we asked 749 of our bettors why they bet, 610 of them, 81.44% said that they bet for the purpose of making money. That was the largest number of responses we got for this question. In 2019, more people&nbsp; gambled for money.</p>



<p>Online betting is lucrative and some bettors who are really good at it, walk away with wins running into millions and it is a fast way to make money.</p>



<p><strong>4: Which Countries Bet the Most</strong></p>



<p>Our survey showed that out  of the 5 African countries that took the survey, Nigeria had the highest number of bettors. They were 423, 57.48% Nigerians out of 749 people from other African countries and America, who took the survey. Nigerians are passionate about sports, especially football and they have some of the best betting sites like Betensured which is always willing to reward that passion with the best odds, promos, betting strategies and every other thing they&#8217;ll need to make betting and cashing out easy for them </p>



<p><strong>5: Where Do People Bet</strong></p>



<p>Mobile phones are the most preferred medium of placing bets, 66.71% of our bettors agree. In 2019, when we asked our bettors the question &#8220;How Do You Gamble?&#8221; mobile phones were chosen as the least preferred method of betting.</p>



<p>Now, mobile phones are more convenient for placing bets because they&#8217;re easily accessible.</p>



<p><strong>6: The Favourite Betting Markets for Bettors in Nigeria</strong></p>



<p>The Favourite football market for bettors in Nigeria is a straight win, this is according to 35.51% people, 266 bettors, the largest number for this response.</p>



<p><strong>7: Favourite Leaque People Bet On</strong></p>



<p>487 of our bettors, 66.02% say that English Premier League is their favourite league to bet on.</p>



<p>If you are interested, you can check out some <a href="https://www.betensured.com/predictions/football/England-Premier-League">football predictions for our English Premier League.</a></p>



<p><strong>8: Number of Betting Sites People Use</strong></p>



<p>242 of our bettors, 34.33% use two betting websites for betting on sports, this is the highest number for this question. In 2019, when we asked our bettors a similar question: How Many Bookmakers Do You Use? 37.3% of gamblers said they use one bookmaker, that was the highest number of responses at that time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>2019 VS 2021</strong>: <strong>State Of Online Betting In Nigeria</strong></h2>



<p>On comparing the two surveys &#8211; (go here to check out the <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-survey-2019-understand-the-betting-industry/">first survey in 2019</a>), we took on online betting and generally people&#8217;s behavior towards it, we discovered that not much has changed in the past 2 years as we found some similarities in how people bet now and how they bet then.</p>



<p>Similarities in bettors behaviours we found include:</p>



<ul><li>Men bet more than women in 2019 and again in 2021.</li><li>Nigeria still bets more than Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana. We had the highest number of online bettors in both 2019 and 2021.</li><li>The reason with the most response as to why people bet, was for the money. More people bet for money in 2019, and that pattern was repeated in 2021.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<ul><li>97.20% men gamble more than women and only 2.67% women bet.</li><li>70.5% of bettors use one or more than one betting sites.</li><li>81.44% bettors admitted to betting for the purpose of making money.</li><li>33.69% of people between 25-31 years bet more than other age grades.</li><li>Nigeria bets more than other African countries.</li><li>66.7% Bettors agree that mobile phones are the most preferred medium of betting.</li><li>35.51% people agree that a straight win is their favourite football market.</li><li>Our bettors favourite sports market is football, 97.2% agree.</li><li>Favourite league to bet on is European Premier League.</li><li>34.22% of bettors say that the bet on 2 sites.</li></ul>



<p>Online betting has evolved into something better and more convenient than how people used to bet in the past, but while some bettors&#8217; behaviour changed over the years; like going from betting on a road side kiosk to betting with your devices, somethings about betting hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>



<p>From two years ago till now, people continue going into online betting for money as they did two years ago, men are still betting more than women, and Nigeria bets more than other African countries, placed in the same class of countries that are passionate about sports as it is.</p>



<p>We think <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-for-beginners-how-to-bet-on-football/">online betting</a> has come to stay, and the more it grows, the more bettors will find new ways to adapt to these upgrades made to it.</p>

<p>UEFA Champions League is one of the oldest and most reputed football tournaments across the world and it is considered as one of the ideals ones in the world of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.casino-online-canada.ca/sportsbook/" target="_blank">sports betting</a> as well! </p>



<p>It is over six decades old and the tournament has witnessed many changes in this time frame. The present format of the tournament has 32 teams which are divided into 8 groups with 4 teams in each group named A to H. </p>



<p>By the way, do you think the <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/has-the-premier-league-season-restart-been-a-disappointment/">Premier League season restart has been a huge disappointment?</a></p>



<p>They are going to play within each other in the group at the group stage and finally, 16 teams will make it to the next round and the rest will get eliminated. The draw of the tournament is out just a few days back and everything looks well placed. </p>



<p>So let&#8217;s have a preview of the tournament and of the upcoming matches and try to find out what is in the offering in this year&#8217;s UEFA Champions League.</p>



<p>If you are interested in getting the latest football prediction tips, check out the <a href="https://www.betensured.com">#1 football prediction site in Nigeria</a></p>



<p>We are just a few days away from the most exciting and popular European Club football tournament. Champions league matches are going to commence in a couple of days from now and the draws are already out. While some of the groups have good competition, others does not seem to have that much of a competition as such. However, predictions and permutations and combinations are good till the <a href="http://www.betensured.com/blog/unveiling-nigerias-best-football-prediction-site">match starts</a> and it makes up for a good starter. The present level of most of the teams is great and they have the caliber and ability to surprise and change the results. In this article, we are going to have a quick look at the draw and the groups and we are going to analyze and predict the results of the preliminary matches of the Champions League.</p>



<p>Group A</p>



<p>Club Brugge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Galatasaray AŞ</p>



<p>Paris Saint-Germain&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Real Madrid CF</p>



<p>Group A consists of the above 4 teams. Real Madrid has won
the tournament for the maximum time and they seem to be the favorite for
topping this group as well. However, there seems to be a close competition for
the second spot. All three teams have their fair chances to make it into the
knockout stage. It would be interesting to see which among the other three
would make it in the next round.</p>



<p>Group B</p>



<p>FC Bayern München&nbsp; </p>



<p>FK Crvenazvezda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Olympiacos FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Tottenham Hotspur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group B consists of above 4 teams. Out of these four
Tottenham Hotspur seems to lead the group. However, there is no guarantee that
they are going to top the group. Other teams are equally good and they can
surprise each other and therefore it would be hard to determine which among
these four teams would make it to the next round. However, Tottenham seems to
be favorite for topping this group with other options quite wide open.</p>



<p>Group C</p>



<p>Atalanta BC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>FC Shakhtar Donetsk </p>



<p>GNK Dinamo Zagreb&nbsp; </p>



<p>Manchester City FC</p>



<p>Group C has Manchester City FC and Atlanta BC as quite
favorites for topping the group. They are comparatively well placed and stand a
very good chance of making it into the knockout stage. It seems that they are
unlikely to suffer any surprises and should make it comfortably into the last
16 stage.</p>



<p>Group D</p>



<p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen </p>



<p>Club Atlético de Madrid</p>



<p>FC Lokomotiv Moskva</p>



<p>Juventus</p>



<p>Group D consists of above 4 teams. Juventus seems to be favorite
for topping the group. Although the other two teams have good chances of
surprising each other and they can also give a good run for money to Juventus.
This is an interesting group and we have to wait till the end to determine
which two teams make it to the next round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group E</p>



<p>FC Salzburg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>KRC Genk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Liverpool FC&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>SSC Napoli</p>



<p>The defending Champions Liverpool are placed in group E.
There are some good teams in this group is well but Liverpool and FC Salzburg
seems to be stronger than the other two teams. However, there are good chances
that Nepali and krcgenk can surprise each other and make it into the next
round.</p>



<p>Group F</p>



<p>Borussia Dortmund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>FC Barcelona</p>



<p>FC Internazionale Milano</p>



<p>SK Slavia Praha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group F seems to be most interesting as well as the strongest
and toughest group. It has Barcelona which is the most popular team of the
tournament. Apart from it, the group has got AC Milan which is a strong team
closely follows by Dortmund and Praha. All these teams have strong players and
fans support. It would be interesting to see which among these&nbsp; 4 are able
to make it to the next round As said earlier, this is the toughest group of the
tournament.</p>



<p>Group G</p>



<p>FC Zenit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Olympique Lyonnais&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>RB Leipzig&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>SL Benfica</p>



<p>Group G consists of the above 4 teams. All of these teams are
at par with each other and they have chances of making it to the next round.
They are good chances of draws as well. Therefore the goal difference can also
play a crucial role to determine the final two teams that make it to the round
of 16. This is an open group and can have any of the two out of the four, who would
make it to the next round.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Group H</p>



<p>AFC Ajax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Chelsea FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>LOSC Lille</p>



<p>Valencia CF</p>



<p>Group H is yet another interesting group with Ajax, Chelsea
along with Valencia CF in it. All these teams are more or less at par with each
other and they could well surprise each other at any time and in any match. So
we have to wait till the end to determine which among these four teams finally
make it into the next round.</p>



<p><strong>Final
words</strong></p>

He is also rated among the CR7 which are legends in the world of sports and would soon join the Billionaire club when he hits 1 billion. He has had his fair share of migration from club to club. He was first in Juventus and he went to play with Real Madrid, soon he became the star of Manchester United and his leaving broke the heart of many of the fans because he was and still is the highest goal scorer. He is back home to Juventus which is his highest signing fee. He has a number of trophies and individual awards received over time; 3 premier leagues cup, 5 champions leagues cup, 4 champions league golden boot and the highest goal scorer in Portugal. He has a number of businesses he is running, his fashion line and many others that has accumulated to giving him the net worth of $500 million.</li>
<li><strong>David Beckham</strong> ranks as the second richest footballer as of this year 2020 with the net worth of $450 million. Though he is retired and the calculation of this net worth is a combination of what he and his wife Victoria Beckham makes; she is singer/designer. His annual salary then was $50 million and as at this year, after retirement, his salary, endorsements and many other businesses in cumulative sums up to that $450 million. He started his 20-years career in Manchester United where he won 6 premier leagues. He signed up for Real Madrid and towards the end of his contract with them, he won the La Liga Championship. He is reputed to be the first English player to win big time in all the clubs he was signed in.

<li><strong>Lionel Messi</strong> is the third on this list and his net worth has been estimated to be $400 million both from his salary which is $84 million and also the many endorsements that tons up to $27 million. The Argentine famous footballer was once reputed to be the world’s richest footballer in the year 2018. He has stuck to Barcelona since he started playing professional football. He has been playing for the club from then till now and though there are rumors of him wanting to sign up with another club, that’s beyond our scope of discussion in this article. He has signed some life time deals with Pepsi, Adidas, Nike, Hawkers, Huawei and Gatorade. He is among the best players the world has ever known though he has not yet won any World Cup trophy for Argentina where he is captain but no one can deny that he has made a mark in the sands of time in the area of football, especially as one of the best strikers of all time and have scored over 400 goals in the history of La Liga.</li>
</ol>
<p>He has won several awards. 4 UEFA Champions Leagues title, 6 copper Del Rey, 6 Golden boots and most hattricks in the Spanish La Liga.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Dave Whelan</strong> is a retired footballer who played in the 90s and may not be known by many in this time but for the old school, they would recognize the name and face. He played for Blackburn Rovers and Crewe Alexander in his days but had an interruption in his career because of a knee injury. Though he still played a bit after the injury until he finally retired. He got into business and became a pro. Now, his net worth is $210 million from football and business. He is number 4 of the top richest.</li>
<li><strong>Neymar</strong> is one of the world’s most popular and great players presently. His net worth is $200 million. He has played for several clubs and he has some endorsements. He earns about $78 million as salary and his recent signing into Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 has made him get the reputation for being the highest paid footballer in that club. Still on the contract he signed, he is to earn 1.7 million per year. He got other offers from Santos which he first rejected but later on took a lesser deal that made him get $4 million instead of the $20 million deal initially proposed; he signed a huge deal with Barcelona that made him earn 15 million per year in salary. He also signed some other deals and endorsements. In this year alone, he has earned about $96 million and on top of that, from his endorsements, he has earned an average of $20-40 million. All these add up to make up his net worth.</li>
<li><strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> the Sweden player has a net worth of $190 million with a salary of $35 million which turns out to be his highest annual salary when he was still with Man United and he has had to accept lower offers. He also is famously known as a great striker and can also qualify as one of the most decorated football players of all times. He has gone through several clubs, Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona. He has won several awards and he played in Ac Milan this year 2020. He has the highest scored goal in Sweden, his country, that counts to 62 goals in total.</li>

<li><strong>Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima</strong> a name that once rang strong bells as he broke many records at his young age. His career in football was a short but very memorable. He had an early retirement due to some bad injuries but he also made money in his days as he set the pace for strikers of this time. He has a net worth of $160 million.

Barcelona in the 90s signed him with what was considered a huge sum at that time; $19.5 million, he spent the 96’-97’ season with them, scored the highest goals and soon moved to Milan where he also broke a record for his high fee of 27 million. He has signed several contracts, deals and endorsements with brands like Nike, Snickers and others. He also became the highest share holder by buying about 51% of the shares of the club Real Valladolid in 2018 and he assumed his duties of managing the club with a goal to have the best team produced from there.</li>
<li><strong>Gareth Bale </strong>is a Welsh footballer whose net worth is $125 million. One big event that qualifies him to be among the first 10 is that he signed the biggest deals ever with Real Madrid from 2013 that will be stretched through to 2020.

<p>Chalk this up as a North London derby classic with lots of goals and a lot of spirit. Arsenal was in control for most of the early stages but were losing at half-time (that is yet another loss/draw at half-time for the gunners). In previous years, heads may have gone down and Tottenham would have easily buried the game. Unai Emery played his hands early by making two substitutions (credit to him) and both players had a role to play in Arsenal’s comeback. For Tottenham, the decision to play Juan Foyth ahead of Toby Alderweireld is completely baffling especially considering the fact that Jan Vertonghen is just returning from injury and is still gaining fitness. Their defending was not what we have come to expect from Tottenham with Foyth being poor for Lacazzette’s goal and then Vertonghen getting sent off later on. Arsenal seems to have a different attitude especially when playing the big teams. Up next for Arsenal, Manchester United.</p>

<p>Another derby over in Merseyside in which the game looked like it was going to end in a stalemate (Van Dijk thought so as well) until Jordan Pickford mistimed the flight of the ball and allowed Divok Origi (yes, you saw that correctly) nod into an empty post in the last minute of the game. Everton seems to have improved and had Andre Gomez scored with his header from six yards, the game would have turned out differently (by score-line, definitely). Liverpool went with all three points. They have not had their players firing on all cylinders yet but are unbeaten and no matter what they do, they are still two points behind Manchester City.</p>

<p>Manchester United had to show some steel to come back from two-goals down (again) and go in level in the first half. After the restart, it was expected that they would continue from where they left off but shocking, it seemed like the attacking threats just dried up. Another two points dropped for the Red Devils. They keep slipping away from the top four.</p>

<p>For Real Madrid, it was really important that they got back to winning ways after their terrible performance last weekend. They were assured in possession and the absence of Marcelo meant that most of their attacks came from the Dani Carvajal, who ran the right channel excellently and was involved in both goals. Real Madrid still fifth, five points behind leaders Barcelona, who took advantage of slip-ups from Sevilla and Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>PSV’s winning streak came to an end over the weekend as a resilient Feyenoord team ensured that PSV went home with nothing. Feyenoord bossed the first half and scored twice (could have been more). In the second half, PSV had chances to level the game but some poor choices and poor finishing meant that they left with nothing. PSV still top of the league, with Ajax hot on their tails.</p>

<p>Paris St Germain finally dropped its first points in 15 games after their entertaining 2-2 draw against Bordeaux. PSG took the lead twice and were pegged back by a very determined Bordeaux side. Nothing to be worried about as they still hold a handsome 14-point lead over second placed Montpellier who happened to beat sorry Monaco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another week, another low for Monaco. Right now, it does not seem like Thierry Henry can get this team out of this rot. Admittedly, there are still loads of injuries but this Monaco team does not have  structure or cohesion, giving away two goals in the final ten minutes of the game after taking the lead. More work needs to be done, and fast, else the teams above would continue to drift away.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, all the attention has been from whether Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool can finally win the elusive Premier League (or even go the whole season unbeaten) to whether Maurizio Sarri’s “Sarri-ball” will take a long while for the Chelsea players to adapt to (it clearly hasn’t) to whether Eden Hazard is the best player in the Premier League and if he can score 40 goals this season to the Manchester United-Jose Mourinho-Paul Pogba fiasco and obviously their recent defeat to West Ham. Nobody has paid much attention to Manchester City recently (and that is a great plus for them) considering the fact that they won the League last season, breaking a number of records along the way. Over the weekend, they went about their business and are currently top of the League, easily beating Brighton and Hove Albion and not conceding in their last two games. The question now is, will they come back down now that they are up?</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United, oh Manchester </strong></p>

<p>The signs were there before today. Nobody seemed confident that they would win this game, considering that West Ham were picking up steam after being on the losing end of their first four premier league games. Alexis Sanchez did not make the 18-man squad. Manchester United did not disappoint, and were unsurprisingly beaten 3-1. Manchester United cannot slip up anymore this season. No more errors.</p>
<p><strong>The Chelsea-Liverpool rematch still does not disappoint.</strong></p>

<p>After the mid-week Carabao cup where these two teams met, we wanted more of the same as the likes of Hazard, Salah, Firmino and Giroud started. They did not disappoint. There was some sub-par finishing (I’m looking at you Hazard and Salah) but the score-line was even based on the balance of play. Liverpool (and Daniel Sturridge) had to pull a rabbit out of a hat to snatch a point after some poor finishing. Both sides have lots of quality players and play some quality football but their forwards need to be more clinical in order to be in contention in the long run. Hazard alone cannot score all the goals as Giroud and Morata have a combined one goal (Granit Xhaka has the same number alone), the Liverpool front three have not been sharp as well.</p>
<p><strong>Juventus cannot be stopped.</strong></p>

<p>In their biggest Serie A game of the season, Juventus made a very resounding statement. Ronaldo, their most influential player, had a hand in all three goals but did not score. He was still the best player on the pitch. Napoli on the other hand, put themselves about but you just get the feeling that they can only push Juventus so far. After seven games, Juventus is currently six points ahead. Who is stopping them now?</p>
<p><strong>Bayern Munich slip up and Dortmund take full advantage..</strong></p>

<p>If you thought that the Bundesliga was done and dusted before the season started, think again. Bayern Munich was shockingly poor on Friday against Hertha Berlin and were duly beaten. Dortmund were set up to take advantage but were two goals down in no time. They had to dig deep and score four goals. Dortmund is quite poor defensively but know how to score goals, but how long can they keep that up for. Still, credit should go to Lucien Favre for blooding these young players. Dortmund is top of the League.</p>
<p><strong>Draws in the Madrid Derby and for Barcelona..</strong></p>

<p>The Madrid derby was a bit disappointing over the weekend. Atletico Madrid would be the happier of the two sides and this still leaves the La Liga wide open. At the Nou Camp, Barcelona had to come from behind to snatch a draw, with Lionel Messi having to come from the bench to register an assist. Sevilla is the only team to have taken full advantage over the last weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Ronaldo finally breaks his Serie A duck..</strong></p>
<p>Every week, since Ronaldo signed for Juventus, people had been saying that he was due a</p>
<p>goal. On Sunday, the wait was over. Ronaldo bagged a brace in a 2-1 victory against an</p>
<p>unbeaten Sassuolo side. He could easily have had four. That was meant to be the headline</p>
<p>but I guess Douglas Costa was a bit jealous. He elbowed, head-butted and then spat on</p>
<p>Federico Di Francesco’s face. To describe how silly his actions were, Serie A currently uses</p>
<p>VAR, so there was no way he would have gotten away with it. Absolutely shocking. And</p>
<p>stupid.</p>

<p>The Liverpool juggernaut continues…</p>
<p>In arguably the biggest game of the weekend, Liverpool played Tottenham at Wembley. To</p>
<p>say Liverpool deserved to win the game is an understatement. Tottenham looked so</p>
<p>lethargic and lost the ball in very sensitive areas and were extremely lucky to lose by one</p>
<p>goal, no thanks to Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah. Tottenham on the other hand have</p>
<p>not been very convincing so far in as much as they have been able to beat Manchester</p>
<p>United at Old Trafford. Liverpool currently has 5 wins in a row, their best ever start in a very</p>
<p>long time and after scaling their first hurdle in a list of consecutive difficult games, they have</p>
<p>greatly increased their chances of still being in the running of winning their first League Title</p>
<p>in 28 years.</p>

<p>Chelsea picking up steam…</p>
<p>Considering the fact that Chelsea is adjusting to life under new management, they are still</p>
<p>one of the teams to beat this season. Playing great football, getting the best out of their key</p>
<p>players is all that could be ask of. They seem to be the running for the Premier League as</p>
<p>well. Hazard looks like he is having the time of his life at the moment and looks like he will</p>
<p>have his biggest goal return this season.</p>

<p>Arsenal makes it 3-in-3….</p>
<p>Arsenal looked fairly solid against Newcastle but buckled a bit under some pressure towards</p>
<p>the end of the game. Ozil crowned his 200 th appearance with a goal (ultimately, the winning</p>
<p>goal). All in all, credit should go to Emery. To put in context, Unai Emery has won two away</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>games (consecutively if I may add), Wenger won one away game from January till May.</p>
<p>Right direction? I think so.</p>

<p>What is going on in Atletico Madrid?</p>
<p>After the signing of a number of attacking players, most especially Lemar and Gelson</p>
<p>Martins, many of us thought that this could be Atletico’s year considering the fact that they</p>
<p>have always been solid defensively. That has not been the case so far. Before the weekend,</p>
<p>they had played 3, won once, drawn once and lost once. What was most telling was the fact</p>
<p>that they had scored only two goals. Also, their most dependable part of the pitch (defense)</p>
<p>had been committing so many individual errors (see Diego Godin’s slip against Celta Vigo).</p>
<p>This past weekend, a misplaced pass in the middle of the pitch led to them conceding and</p>
<p>having to dig really deep to get a late (very late) equaliser at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
<p>It is still early days but things need to change or they will be looking up at the table in no</p>
<p>time.</p>

<p>Is the Anoeta curse broken.. Real Madrid held at the San Mames?</p>
<p>To put into context: before last season, the last time Barcelona won at the Anoeta was when</p>
<p>Frank Rijkaard was coach. Now, under Valverde, they have made it two in a row. Ousmane</p>
<p>Dembele is gradually becoming a key player in this Barcelona engine. Elsewhere, Real</p>
<p>Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw against Athletic Bilbao at the San Mames. It is still early days</p>
<p>but Real Madrid cannot afford too many slips before the El-Clasico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the madness of this great World Cup is gradually fizzing out, we have decided to take a look at the best performers at this tournament.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium)</strong></p>
<p>Now this could have easily been Hugo Lloris, but for him gifting Mandzukic the Croats&#8217; second goal in the final.</p>
<p>That and he conceded twice in the final and three against a poor Argentina side.</p>
<p><strong>Right Back: Šime Vrsaljko (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>It was between him and Benjamin Pavard of France but he wins it because of his relentless running and forward thinking approach throughout the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Center Back: Rafael Varane (France)</strong></p>
<p>What a year this man is having.</p>
<p>Champions League winner to World Cup winner in a little over 1 month.</p>
<p>He produced some assured and solid displays and also got the crucial opening goal against Uruguay.</p>
<p><strong>Diego Godin (Uruguay)</strong></p>
<p>This was a selection headache between him and Samuel Umtiti.</p>
<p>Godin showed a very high level of calmness and assuredness in the face of danger particularly in the latter stages of the game against Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>Left Back: Lucas Hernandez (France)</strong></p>
<p>For this particular position, he has no competition in this tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Ngolo Kante ( France)</strong></p>
<p>Prior to this tournament, we thought we&#8217;d be putting Toni Kroos on this list.</p>
<p>Again, Kante is in a class of his own.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Luka Modric (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>Started most games slowly but imposed himself as games progressed. Winning the trophy itself was just a step too far. Deserved Golden Ball winner as well.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Paul Pogba (France)</strong></p>
<p>This is the most consistent that we have seen Pogba post Juventus. He was never over elaborate and was very efficient. Got a good goal in the final as well.</p>
<p><strong>Left Forward: Ivan Perisic (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>Now this was a tussle between him and Eden Hazard of Belgium.</p>
<p>He gets the nod because he was effective throughout the knock-out stages, also considering that him and his team had to play 3 consecutive extra-time games. Scored three very good goals as well.</p>
<p><strong>Right Forward: Kylian Mbappe (France)</strong></p>
<p>Mr Golden Boy.</p>
<p>Was very brazen and dared to take on defenders when in possession.</p>
<p>Did his fair bit in defending as well.</p>
<p><strong>Center Forward: Romelu Lukaku (Belgium)</strong></p>
<p>If we had our way, we would have played with a false nine and stuck Cheryshev up there for all we cared. It was not a fantastic tournament for number 9s. Harry Kane could have easily been up there by virtue of his six goals but he was practically non-existent after the group games.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>Kindly share your thoughts about your own best eleven at this tournament.</p>
<p>Till later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is growing increasingly frustrated at the club&#8217;s reluctance to spend £40 million on Tottenham defender Danny Rose.</strong></p>
<p>Last month, a report from <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/tottenham-set-price-danny-rose-11626748">The Mirror</a> suggested that Tottenham would sell the England international for £50 million in January, but it seems the Old Trafford board aren&#8217;t as keen as Mourinho to sign the left-back.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The situation is reportedly causing tension between Mourinho and the board.</p>
<div class="social-embed" contenteditable="false">
<div contenteditable="false">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has told Jose Mourinho he cannot sign Danny Rose in January.</p>
<p>[Mirror] <a href="https://t.co/U0Hj8bhwm8">pic.twitter.com/U0Hj8bhwm8</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Rose was heavily linked with a move to United in the summer transfer window, and although Mourinho was desperate to sign four players in the summer, he only ended up getting three: Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic.</p>
<p>Back in August last year, Rose spoke about his immediate future at Tottenham Hotspur and the 27-year-old didn&#8217;t hold back in an explosive interview.</p>
<p>Rose, who arguably had the best season of his career in 2016/17, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4209426/tottenham-danny-rose-exclusive-wage-worth/">The Sun</a> that he wants &#8220;to play up north&#8221;. He also admitted that &#8220;time is running out&#8221; to win trophies, while suggesting that he wants a pay rise at Spurs.</p>
<div></div>

<p>The defender then went onto admit that he hopes Tottenham make a couple more signings, but &#8220;not players you have to Google and say, &#8216;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Rose told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4209426/tottenham-danny-rose-exclusive-wage-worth/">The Sun</a> in a revealing interview: &#8220;At my age, and having missed six months with injury, I have been thinking about this quite a lot,&#8221; the 27-year-old said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am reaching my peak and have probably only got one big contract left in me. Time is running out and I do want to win trophies. I don&#8217;t want to play football for 15 years and not have one trophy or one medal. Sorry, that&#8217;s not what I am about. I wouldn&#8217;t be happy with that. <a href="https://www.betensured.com">I want to win something</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mourinho has expressed the need for a new left-back and centre midfielder, but as per Miguel Delaney from <i><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/manchester-united-transfer-news-january-targets-shortlist-jose-mourinho-carlos-soler-valencia-a8054046.html">The Independent</a></i>, Mourinho has identified Valencia&#8217;s Carlos Soler as his No.1 transfer target.</p>
<p>Soler, 20, only made his first-team debut just under a year ago but has been integral to Valencia&#8217;s success, making 11 appearances &#8211; scoring once and registering four assists.</p>
<p>His performances have alerted Mourinho and his staff, who feel he could a bit of creativity that United have been bereft of in the absence of record signing Paul Pogba.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gareth Bale was making his first start in three months</p>
<p>Numancia, fifth in Spain&#8217;s second division, had Pape Maly Diamanka sent-off on the hour mark.</p>
<p>Isco then scored another penalty and Borja Mayoral headed in a late third.</p>
<p>Bale has been restricted to just six appearances in La Liga this season because of injuries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Marseille have suspended Patrice Evra after he kicked a fan in the head before his side&#8217;s Europa League defeat at Vitoria Guimaraes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Footage showed the 36-year-old former Manchester United defender aiming an acrobatic kick at a supporter at the side of the pitch during the warm-up.</p>
<p>Evra will be interviewed before any disciplinary action is decided.</p>
<p>A Marseille statement also condemned the &#8220;unacceptable behaviour&#8221; by a &#8220;handful of provocateurs&#8221;.</p>
<p>European football&#8217;s governing body Uefa charged France international Evra with violent conduct earlier on Friday, with the full-back suspended for &#8220;at least one game&#8221;.</p>
<p>French newspaper L&#8217;Equipe<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external"></i> reported that Marseille supporters had been jeering Evra for about half an hour while the players prepared for the game, which the Ligue 1 side lost 1-0.</p>
<p>The player had gone over to the fans to talk to them &#8211; but the situation escalated.</p>
<p>Evra, who was named as a substitute, was dismissed before kick-off, and Marseille began the game with 11 players.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a professional and experienced player, Patrice Evra could not respond in such an inappropriate way,&#8221; the statement added.<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external"></i></p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the first results of the internal investigation conducted by the club reveal unacceptable behaviour on the part of a handful of provocateurs who uttered particularly serious hateful attacks against the player, even though the latter and his team-mates warmed up for an important game.&#8221;</p>
<p>His former Manchester United team-mate, Mikael Silvestre, told BBC Sport that Evra had &#8220;no future&#8221; at Marseille, but that the incident would not be the end of his career.</p>
<div id="story-body" class="story-body sp-story-body gel-body-copy">
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">How it happened</h3>
<ul>
<li>Named as a substitute, Evra begins warming up with his team-mates before the game</li>
<li>The former Manchester United left-back appears to be the target of songs and abuse from the crowd for about 30 minutes</li>
<li>Evra approaches the Marseille fans, about 500 of whom had travelled to Guimaraes</li>
<li>He volleys a ball towards the crowd, but some of his team-mates come over and look to calm the defender down</li>
<li>Evra climbs over the billboards and looks to confront spectators who have come towards the front of the stand</li>
<li>The 36-year-old returns to the pitch, but a group of fans approach the billboards and Evra appears to kick one of them</li>
<li>Evra is led away to the substitutes&#8217; bench, but is sent off by the referee and watches the game from the stands</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">Analysis</h3>
<p><i>Julien Laurens, French football expert</i></p>
<p>It is really sad. Patrice Evra is 36, he has got two children. He has played five Champions League finals, a Euro final, won lots of titles and this is probably the last few weeks of his career &#8211; it is really sad this is how he is going to end.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t abuse your own player &#8211; the abuse from the fans was targeted only at Evra &#8211; but Evra should never have responded the way he did.</p>
<p>It has been really tough for him since the beginning of the season. He lost his place in the team, he has been really poor every time he played, and I think he just couldn&#8217;t take the jeers, the abuse.</p>
<p>There were a lot of insults, but the fans were also saying stuff like: &#8220;You&#8217;re rubbish, go home. Keep doing your videos, but stop playing football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way they insulted him and his family &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t justify his reaction &#8211; but you can see why he got frustrated.</p>
<p>He is 100%. He says things like they are, he reacts the way they are. He says there are no fibs with him, so you get it as he says it or as he does it. Sometimes he should think a bit more.</p>
