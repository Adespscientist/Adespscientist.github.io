Lots of goals, lots of upsets, lots of controversies. It would have been a bit difficult to accurately predict games this weekend and we understand. There is always next time no?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Manchester United leave it late\u2026very late..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manchester United has not started the season well. Over the weekend, they were eventually able to overcome a very organized and resolute Brighton side. Scoring a winning penalty after 100 minutes of play is not something that happens every game week, let alone, every game and as such this should not be the type of wins that Manchester United should be looking forward to every game. For Solskjaer and his team, it is three points picked up albeit playing very averagely for most of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Brighton, it would have been a tough one to swallow seeing as they hit the woodwork 5 times. It is also a case of \u2018glass half full\u2019 as they seem to be playing some entertaining stuff and it seems unlikely (based on two games) that they would be struggling with the bottom teams come the end of the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Juventus hold their own..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roma lost their first game by three goals to nil due to a technicality and they could not have handpicked a more difficult game. AS Roma had better chances and played most of the second half with an extra man but could not take full advantage. Ultimately, getting a point from the Champions is not too shabby. Paolo Fonseca still has work to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Juventus, Andrea Pirlo is still having a feel of this team. One thing is for certain though: Ronaldo, who should be at the twilight of his career in an ideal world, is still the main man for Juventus and is miles ahead in terms of consistent performances. If only one or two more players can match that level of consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Bayern Munich finally defeated..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bayern Munich, the team that every neutral seems to love was defeated emphatically on Saturday. Some people had said that it was eventually bound to happen as their defending has always been suspect. Hansi Flick had to try and rest some of his players at a point and he did in this game, resting Lewandowski and Goretzka and this ultimately backfired. Flick and Bayern Munich would probably not lose a lot of sleep as they are still favourites to lift the Bundesliga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Liverpool defence continues..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the best way to play against Liverpool? Do you play like Leeds United or do you play like Arsenal? The answer so far this season is still unknown as Liverpool continued their winning streak. Arsenal made it a bit difficult and had a golden chance to bring the score level at a point but Liverpool was ultimately too good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Arsenal, it was always going to be a difficult game and Arteta would need to learn and evolve quickly if he wants to take his team to the destination he sees them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Paris Saint Germain on a comeback..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a rocky start to the season, PSG is gradually getting back to their best, winning their last 3 and conceding none in the process. If they keep this up, they will be back on top of Ligue 1 in no timr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Barcelona and Koeman off to a bright start..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald Koeman could not have asked for a better result, dispatching Villarreal with relative ease and Ansu Fati putting in a man-of-the-match performance, an award that he could not collect because the sponsor of the award was a beer company and he was below drinking age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also seems that Coutinho would have an important role to play for Barcelona this season. This are looking up at the Camp Nou.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a great weekend of football! Lots of goals, lots of upsets, lots of controversies.
