<p>We do not need all the suspense, do we? The
League is the Serie A.</p>



<p>Juventus has a monopoly in this League. Since
the 2011-2012 season, Juventus has been the winner of the Serie A. That was 9
seasons ago. Since then, only Napoli have tried to push them to the wire but
the Juventus hegemony could not be defeated- credit to Maurizio Sarri for that
push while with Napoli. </p>



<p>Now, Maurizio Sarri is with Juventus and the
competition has come alive again. This is partly due to him still finding his
feet with the Old Lady and the arrival and resurgence of Inter Milan under
Antonio Conte. All this is good but the emergence of less fancied teams like
Lazio under Simone Inzaghi who are six points behind the joint leaders (and the
only team to have beaten Juventus this season), albeit with a game in hand and
the form of Ciro Immobile, arguably the most in form striker in Europe (yeah,
we know that there is Lewandowski please) is making the League all the more fun
and unpredictable.</p>



<p>To a lesser – competitive &#8211; extent, there are
also teams like A.S. Roma and Atalanta managed by Paulo Fonseca and Gian Piero
Gasperini respectively who are very entertaining, score loads of goals and
ultimately have been fairly consistent this season.</p>



<p>What more could you ask for in a League that has arguably the best footballer of all time in Ronaldo, the highest goal-scorer in Europe in Ciro Immobile, one of the best Coaches in Europe in Antonio Conte. Oh, and there is now Zlatan Ibrahimovic? – there are no superlatives for Zlatan. Not a lot more, I presume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In case you have not noticed, Barcelona is
under new Management. The change was made in the middle of the season. They
were top of the La Liga, although they just lost in the Spanish Super Cup to
Atletico Madrid. A relatively irrelevant game in the grand scheme of things.</p>



<p>Now, according to sources, Valverde’s style
of play did not sit well with the Barcelona faithful. However, it seemed like
his only downfall- or downfalls- were the second-leg defeats to Roma and Liverpool
in the 2018 and 2019 Champions League seasons respectively.</p>



<p>The first question goes thus: if Valverde
and Barcelona won at least on Champions League medal while he was in charge,
would he have been fired with the same reasons that were given?</p>



<p>Under Setien, the results read thus:
P4W3L1. Not a bad record for a new manager. However, when you take over from a
Manager that was joint top in the League, top at the group stages of the
Champions League, those results are nothing extraordinary. Admittedly, the
Manager needs time to understand his team and adjust accordingly. However, this
is Barcelona, the clock is already ticking. Just ask Mr. Valverde.</p>



<p>On the flip side, prior to Ernesto Valverde
taking over at Barcelona, he managed Athletic Bilbao- his second spell there-
where he had a very good record, obviously defeating Barcelona in the Spanish
Super Cup during his spell there being one of them. While in Barcelona, he won
consecutive League titles, winning a double in his first season. Obviously, the
decision made by Barcelona in hindsight seemed a more philosophical one than a
results one.</p>



<p>For Setien, he possesses less coaching
success compared to Valverde- a risk on Barcelona’s part. However, the brand of
football his team plays – albeit without winning trophies- seems to be what
Barcelona fell in love with.</p>



<p>This obviously brings up the old question
of style versus substance. Would you rather manage a team, play a certain way
at the expense of consistently winning or would you discard all the aesthetics
and focus solely on winning? We obviously now what Barcelona has decided. It
seems like there are more troubling issues in Barcelona- like the endless
search for who would replace one of the greatest ever footballers when he
leaves/retires. </p>



<p>We would see how this love story goes.</p>

<ul><li>Where Are My Signings?!</li></ul>



<p>This has been a very disappointing January transfer window as clubs refuse to spend big and address weaknesses. If you’re not a Liverpool fan, you should be worried about your club’s future. With 2 days left till deadline day, it is likely that we&#8217;ll be watching the same players for the next 4 months. Here are the recent updates in transfers.</p>

<p>Champions-elect Liverpool don’t need any signings, yet they snapped up energetic Minamino for only £7m. If rumours of their interest in Mbappe are true, I personally believe the move should be ruled illegal. Just imagine the mayhem Mane, Salah, and Mbappe will cause- with Firmino playing No. 10! Game Over. </p>



<p>As for Man City, Guardiola has confirmed there will be no new signings, and why should there? Look at that star-studded squad, with Leroy Sane back from injury. Meanwhile, 3<sup>rd</sup> place Leicester City need a backup for injured Ndidi, and extra spice- maybe a world-class winger- to be taken seriously. However, there are no plans this January. </p>



<h2>Where are my signings?!</h2>

[REX FEARTURES]</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some clubs don’t take UCL qualification seriously! They form the 3 big losers this January Transfer window- Chelsea, Man Utd, and Tottenham.</p>



<p>Chelsea look just as confused as their manager Frank Lampard- targeting Werner, Sancho, Dembele &amp; Zaha to no fruition. They have the EPL’s worst-keeper Kepa, and an unsettled defence, but have no plans to fix it. This is a team that was given a major boost in December as the transfer ban was lifted, and have a £150m transfer war chest. They are yet to sign a player with 2 days left. This club is a joke!</p>



<p>Man Utd. Glazers. Ed Woodword. It’s looking like another disaster January transfer window for the Red Devils who had their eyes on Bruno Fernandes. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="‘So Bruno Fernandes come to United or no?’ (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10801673/mourinho-jokes-bruno-fernandes-saga/" target="_blank">‘So Bruno Fernandes come to United or no?’</a> Asks a jocular Mourinho. Who wouldn’t find this United side funny? They missed out on Norwegian wonderkid Haaland and now plan to recall Alexis Sanchez! The real tragedy is that Paul Pogba remains in this unhappy marriage.</p>



<p>Tottenham’s only signing is Gedson Fernandes (on loan), a useless one to say the least. With Harry Kane injured and Eriksen joining Inter, Spurs look seriously depleted, and it is unlikely they will loan Gareth Bale. &nbsp;Whereas, rivals Arsenal look set to sign Flamengo star defender Pablo Mari on loan-to-buy, to tighten up the defence.</p>



<h2>Best of the Rest </h2>



<p>A hot rumour is going around that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman is engineering a takeover of Newcastle United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://talksport.com/football/661565/newcastle-takeover-saudi-arabia-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-talksport-source/" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman is engineering a takeover of Newcastle United</a>. While Aston Villa continue spending, introducing washed-up Pepe Reina, and Danny Drinkwater, and securing the exciting Tanzanian forward Samatta. </p>

<p>Conte’s Inter Milan now look ready to take on Juventus. They are the biggest winners this January transfer window, increasing the squad depth by securing Victor Moses, Ashley Young, and the world-class Christian Eriksen for £17m. No doubt Eriksen&#8217;s stock price on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Football Index (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.footballindex.co.uk/" target="_blank">Football Index</a> will rise, and investors will be happy with the move. Juventus are unlikely to sign anyone and are still looking to sell flop Emre Can. Meanwhile, PSG look set on losing Edison Cavani to Atletico.</p>



<p>Real Madrid continue their Brazilian invasion. Raiding the country of their best young talents, with the recent acquisition of wonderkid Reinier Jesus for £25m. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Flamengo really should have charged more for this kid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2869930-jorge-jesus-questions-flamengo-reinier-jesus-value-amid-real-madrid-rumours" target="_blank">Flamengo really should have charged more for this kid</a>. Los Blancos are building for the future, while rivals Barcelona continue to slack. Los Cules lost Suarez to a major injury, and are yet to find a replacement. </p>



<p>Finally, Dortmund stole the headlines with the signing of wonderkid Halaand for £17m, and the Norwegian wasted no time in capturing the hearts of fans, with 5-goals in 2 games. Bayern meanwhile will miss out on top target Sane this January, but are willing to wait before making any major transfer decisions. </p>

<p>The curious case of the Red Devils: defeat
Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City on the bounce, put on a poor performance
at Old Trafford against Everton, a team that was in the relegation zone two
weeks ago, although they seem to have turned a corner under new management. </p>



<p>On a bigger scale, 7 points from 3 games is
a good haul, especially when you consider that they were not really favourites
two win two of the three.</p>



<p>The issue seems to be the set-up.&nbsp; A little bit of context here: Manchester
United has 25 points and have won more points from the 5 teams above them – 13
to be precise – than other 12 teams that they have played below them – 12
points. It is as imbalanced a point haul as you could get.</p>



<p>Playing against the likes of Chelsea,
Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool – to an extent – falls
perfectly into their hands as they have some of the quickest forwards in
Martial, Rashford, James and Lingard – I know, I know – and are one of the best
counter-attacking teams in the globe on their day. Unfortunately, that accounts
for less than 30% of the teams they would face in the League. Essentially,
there are more teams in the bottom half of the Premier League table that they
should be able to take more points from.</p>



<p>The issue however is that when they are
left to control a game and not play on the break, the team is totally devoid of
creativity.</p>



<p>Enter Paul Labile Pogba. We all know that
he has not set the Premier League alight especially considering his high price
tag and we have only seen flashes of his brilliance, but a player of his
quality is sorely needed by the Red Devils. Admittedly, the likes of McTominay,
Fred and co. have held their own when needed but they are not the most creative
players you would ever see.</p>



<p>We all know the abilities that Pogba
possesses. Unfortunately, he does not do this often enough. With the fairly
decent performances of his fellow midfield club mates, it would be expected
that Pogba would have less defensive responsibilities when he becomes fully fit.</p>



<p>For a team as big as Manchester United,
they cannot always expect teams to dominate and push and then leave spaces for
them to counter attack. For them to gather more points against “smaller teams”
that would sit back and become as deep as possible, covering all the spaces,
they would need to utilize their most creative player.</p>
