A pioneer of sports betting, New Jersey continues the winning streak that is causing it to slowly but surely become the gambling capital of the world, not just the country. In particular, Monmouth Park alongside its operator, Darby Development LLC, announced recently that it entered into a 10-year exclusive agreement with the BetMakers that will allow BetMakers to deliver and distribute all fixed odds betting on horse racing in the Garden State.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first deal of its kind that\u2019s ever been presented to North America for its customers. As per the deal, BetMakers will integrate its Fixed Odds technology into betting operators in the state. This will also effectively provide international racing bodies and organizations the chance to offer their racing to New Jersey and American customers via BetMakers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from managing Fixed Odds horse racing in New Jersey, the partnership also gives BetMakers exclusive rights to distribute all of Monmouth Park\u2019s racing content throughout America and all over the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the first of its kind agreement means that BetMakerss will be the sole approved distributor of Fixed Odds horse racing content in New Jersey, thus effectively providing a much-needed solution for racing bodies from both locally and globally to access licensed wagering operators or bookmakers operating in New Jersey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of this agreement, bookmakers will now be able to offer Fixed Odds betting on horse racing events in any state that allows Fixed Odds betting to take place legally. Although New Jersey is the pioneer, BetMakers has plans to create agreements with other race tracks in the state, as well as other parts of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For BookMakers to get in on the Fixed Odds action, they will have to agree to the terms listed in the New Jersey fixed odds model which is designed to pay a portion of its handle or turnover back to the race tracks as Right fees.&nbsp; BetMakers collaborate with Monmouth as well as all the other relevant parties to supply data and integrity reporting solutions that will uphold racing integrity on all Fixed Odds betting in<a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2020\/03\/09\/us\/racehorse-doping-indictments\/index.html\"> horse racing in New Jersey<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will this deal help?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than you can imagine! It\u2019s no secret that the horse racing world is full of scandals and upsets.<a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2019\/07\/21\/us\/monmouth-park-cancels-horse-racing-heat-trnd\/index.html\"> Just recently<\/a>, it was reported than Monmouth Park\u2019s post-race drug tests had stalled the payment of purse money, a situation that negatively impacted all the horsemen implicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the simple truth about races; gamblers don\u2019t like having a horse go into the starting gate at one price and then have to deal with an unexpected price change from half what it was originally halfway through the race. Fixed Odds are fairer and a lot easier to understand once a person gets the hang of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horse racing in America needs to enjoy competitive pricing, heightened transparency, as well as clearer administration of the rules. The North American horse racing market also needs more enhanced product development so that the wagering interests and needs of its customers can be met. New Jersey has taken the first steps and it is expected that more states will follow in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This partnership will also be instrumental in pushing a younger demographic of punters, that are more used to the fixed odds format instead of warm-up or pari-mutuel wagering, towards fixed-odds horse betting. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.njgamblingfun.com\/nj\/sports-news\/is-fixed-odds-wagering-new-jersey\">According to Bob Johnson, <\/a>&nbsp;at NjGamblingFun, with more and more states accepting that sports wagering is a thing now, this partnership couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How exactly do Fixed Odds wagers work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixed Odds allow betters to secure the specific amount or price at the time of their placing a bet. The amount or price to be wagered on will not be subject to any fluctuations mid-race although there may be deductions here and there that will be applied in case of scratchings. Basically, the price that one sees at the time of placing a bet is the price one will be guaranteed regardless of what will happen to the odds after a bet has been placed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fixed odds horse wagering model is the betting style that is utilized for many other sporting events so<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/av\/uk-27225374\"> it\u2019s not new<\/a>. So how is this model different from the pari-mutuel method that\u2019s been used in horse racing for centuries? In pari-mutuel betting, the odds are usually finalized the minute the race starts, just after all the last bets have been placed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixed-odds wagering has been implemented successfully in other parts of the world but it is especially popular across Europe and Australia. As a matter of fact, BetMakers Technology is an Australian-based company. Fixed Odds betting will be done at kiosks but as it grows, it will also be available widely through various betting apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the major operators are currently showing a keen interest, which indicates that it should become popular in a short span. Some of the major operators that are showing interest include Penn Nations, GVC, Flutter, Kindred, Evolution, and Bet365. BetMakers also has agreements with several other tracks in the country that consist of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairmount Park, Collinsville, Illinois<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grants Pass Downs, Grants Pass, Oregon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonial Downs, New Kent, Virginia<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lone Star Park, Grand Prairie, Texas<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerald Downs, Auburn, Washington<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final Thoughts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving punters the transparency they need with Fixed Odds betting, which is what really other major sports have been doing for years, will go a long way in helping to attract a new and hungrier breed of sports betters to thoroughbred racing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixed Odds wagering will also help to satisfy frustrated and experienced punters that aren\u2019t always fairly rewarded for picking a winning horse based on the morning line or some mere hours before the start of the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixed Odds betting has been a constant feature of the betting industry in Australia for years so there is no reason why it shouldn\u2019t succeed in the North American sports wagering market.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Garden State has done it once again.
