It is as imbalanced a point haul as you could get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing against the likes of Chelsea,\nManchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool \u2013 to an extent \u2013 falls\nperfectly into their hands as they have some of the quickest forwards in\nMartial, Rashford, James and Lingard \u2013 I know, I know \u2013 and are one of the best\ncounter-attacking teams in the globe on their day. Unfortunately, that accounts\nfor less than 30% of the teams they would face in the League. Essentially,\nthere are more teams in the bottom half of the Premier League table that they\nshould be able to take more points from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue however is that when they are\nleft to control a game and not play on the break, the team is totally devoid of\ncreativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Paul Labile Pogba. We all know that\nhe has not set the Premier League alight especially considering his high price\ntag and we have only seen flashes of his brilliance, but a player of his\nquality is sorely needed by the Red Devils. Admittedly, the likes of McTominay,\nFred and co. have held their own when needed but they are not the most creative\nplayers you would ever see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know the abilities that Pogba\npossesses. Unfortunately, he does not do this often enough. With the fairly\ndecent performances of his fellow midfield club mates, it would be expected\nthat Pogba would have less defensive responsibilities when he becomes fully fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a team as big as Manchester United,\nthey cannot always expect teams to dominate and push and then leave spaces for\nthem to counter attack. For them to gather more points against \u201csmaller teams\u201d\nthat would sit back and become as deep as possible, covering all the spaces,\nthey would need to utilize their most creative player.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The curious case of the Red Devils: defeat Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City on the bounce, put on a poor performance at Old Trafford against Everton, a team that was in the relegation zone two weeks ago, although they seem to have turned a corner under new management.
