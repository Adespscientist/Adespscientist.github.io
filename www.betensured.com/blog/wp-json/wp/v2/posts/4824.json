We have mentioned this a lot on this platform that\neven if it is not actually true, you will still probably believe it anyway. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, Juventus boasts the best\n35-year old to have played the game (sorry Zlatan) and arguably the best\nfootballer to have ever kicked a football. Juventus sometimes play the best\nfootball, sometimes they just need to show up \u2013 no disrespect to the rest of\nthe League. They are that good. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some of us that have followed\ntheir last couple of League triumphs \u2013 that is a lot of consecutive League\ntriumphs in Europe\u2019s top 5 Leagues \u2013 we need something new. As football\nneutrals \u2013 on most occasions \u2013 we live for goals. Nicely worked goals. Loads of\nnicely worked goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Atalanta Football Club. Current\nsecond in Serie A. Scorers of 93 goals in Serie A with 5 games to go. Scorers\nof over 100 goals this season. Have a left (wing) back in Robin Gosens who has\n9 goals and 8 assists in the Serie A. He also wears the number 8 jersey. Have\nregular substitute players in Ruslan Malinovskyi and Luis Muriel who have a\ncombined 26 goals and 7 assists between them. Champions League Quarter\nFinalists after demolishing Valencia 8-4 on aggregate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the Champions League, after\ngame 4, they looked like they would leave the competition after winning none of\nthe initial games. Miraculous. What would be more miraculous would be if they\nwon the Champions League outright. A man can dream, can he not?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a team where their key man \u2013 Duvan\nZapata- has struggled for fitness a number of times this season, scoring over\n100 goals with a minimum of 7 games to go is no mean feat. A lot of credit to\nGian Piero Gasperini. He may be remembered for his brief and unsuccessful stint\nin Inter Milan some years ago but the brand of football that his current team\nis playing \u2013 where the team, especially in the final third, is as fluid as they\ncan get \u2013 is nothing short of mesmerizing. Some quarters have whispered that he\nmay not be able to cut it at the bigger teams. The rate at which he and his\nteam are going, there may not be a need to move to a \u2018bigger\u2019 team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Football, although a low-scoring sport, is\nmajorly noted for its goals. This is why the best players in the world (and in\nLeagues as well) are mostly attackers. Atalanta is (more or less)\nsinglehandedly trying to make football a high scoring sport worldwide. By\nextension, why should they not be recognised as one of the best teams in the\nworld? Winning the Champions League may just tip the table. Who does not love\nan underdog story?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Juventus will win the Serie A for the eighth consecutive time.
