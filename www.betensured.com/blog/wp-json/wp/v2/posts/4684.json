In all honesty, it has been a subdued January transfer window with most clubs having a preference\nfor the summer window. Borussia Dortmund got a potentially sweet deal when they\nacquired the highly rated Erling Haaland who has already bagged seven goals in\nthree matches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Premier League has been on a\nwinter break, the first of its kind in an updated system of reforms to keep the\nleague fresh and interesting. Speaking of interesting, who ever thought that\nLiverpool would be this dominant? Last season, they were good, really good in\nfact. However, they have grown and evolved to be an unstoppable force. 24 wins\nfrom 25 matches are truly astonishing. This season, they have taken all comers,\nwith the only glitch being held to a frustrating draw at Old Trafford by\nManchester United. The Manchester based club made some moves in the January\nwindow in a bid to salvage their season. Bruno Fernandez was the highest\nprofile signing in the Premier League, joining United in a deal worth around\n55m Euros (\u00a347m) but add-ons could as well increase the overall cost to 80m\neuros (\u00a367.7m). They also added Nigerian international Odion Ighalo on loan\nfrom Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua who reportedly took a pay cut to put on a\nUnited shirt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>United next visit Stamford Bridge to\nface rivals Chelsea. Both teams have played young players in their matches.\nSurprisingly, bookies from William\nHill fancy the Blues to win this one and that is why they have Chelsea\nat 1.83 to win against United\u2019s 4.33. United have won 3 of the last 5 meetings\nbetween the two sides, the last being a 2-1 win in a cup tie. 12BET have an\namazing deal for new players only. The first step is to place 6 bets each with\na minimum stake of \u00a310. If any of the 6 qualifying bets is over \u00a335 it will\nonly count as the \u00a335 maximum and count towards 1 of the 6 qualifying bets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Football and sports generally have\ntranscended the gamer experience. Many fans and gamers alike are in a position\nto take chance on various sports that they fancy. They may not be able to play\nthe game, but they can join in the action from behind the scenes. This aspect\nof gaming has been a global phenomenon for example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/newzealandcasinos.nz\/casino-games\/online-pokies\/\">best online pokies by nz\ncasinos<\/a> give gamers a chance to learn the craft and grow their winnings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you want to explore the thrill\nof gaming in a simple way, <a href=\"https:\/\/casinopro.se\/casino-spel\">casino games in Sweden<\/a> is a good\nfirst step. For the ultimate experience in gaming diversity, you could explore <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elitcasinon.com\/\">ElitCasinon best online list<\/a>. Speaking\nof diversity, the Premier League clubs moved to ensure that the next summer\ntransfer window will close on September 1st. They voted to revert to this\nsystem because of the need to give teams more time to get deals over the line.\nThe recent two summer windows have seen some clubs run out of time, as it would\nclose at mid-August latest. With profitability at its highest due to TV rights\ndeals, it remains to be seen whether or not this will help English football\nclubs get more players in. Traditional heavyweights Manchester United and\nArsenal are no longer the attractive destinations they used to be due to\nperformances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>League leaders Liverpool are on\ncloud nine as they march towards a first Premier League title in 30 years. No\nteam this season seems to have an answer for them. As of the Premier League\nwinter break, the Merseyside club had notched an astonishing 24 wins from 25\nmatches. After the 2-0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur in their last match, Pep\nGuardiola admitted that Liverpool are unstoppable and conceded defeat in the\nrace for the title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can this side get even better? Well in football, there is always room for improvement. In their case, Liverpool indeed can add more fire power with none of their front three being out and out strikers. There have been reports of Kylian Mbappe possibly joining the Reds in the future. However, the stumbling block in such a move which has a huge price tag is that Liverpool would have to let go of their biggest name; Mohammed Salah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>SPONSORED POST<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The drive for clubs to succeed in the second half of the season is in full swing with only a few months left on the top European football calendar.
