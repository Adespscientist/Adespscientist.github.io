Obviously, ours will be no different as we cannot\nguarantee that the team selected- I mean, you can only pick eleven players-\nwill fill all our readers the world over the utmost satisfaction. So, here\ngoes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>ALISSON\nBECKER (GK-LIVERPOOL)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\na name to have! For a goalkeeper to have kept 20 clean sheets with two games\nleft to play is mightily impressive especially considering that it is your\ndebut season in the Premier League. He obviously had an average start to the\nseason but has grown in leaps and bounds since then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>AARON\nWAN-BISSAKA (RB- CRYSTAL PALACE)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\nhas been one of the stand-out players this season and this is all the more\nobvious because he does not play for a top-six team and hence would have to do\nmore defensive work. He is quick, very good going forward and very dependable\nat the back as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>VIRGIL\nVAN DIJK (CB- LIVERPOOL)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\nis difficult to argue about his level of influence on Liverpool as they have\nkept 20 clean sheets and going on to become one of the meanest defences in the\nLeague. He is very solid both on the ground and in the air, which is rare\nconsidering his height. He has also added a fair share of goals, some of them\nvery vital to his club\u2019s ambitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>AYMERIC\nLAPORTE (CB- MANCHESTER CITY)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laporte\narrived around last January, around the same time that Van Dijk joined\nLiverpool and has grown to be a very dependable centre back with very good\npositioning and calmness. He also has great ability in starting attacks from\nthe back with his accurate passing. His team has also conceded the second fewest\ngoals after (guess who) Liverpool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>ANDREW\nROBERTSON (LB- LIVERPOOL)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever\nsince Robertson got into the Liverpool first team last season, he has not\nlooked back. He is arguably the most dependable footballer in the League as he\nsteadily produces top performances. He is a bundle of energy and always ready\nto assist in attack- making him the defender with the highest assists this\nseason- and defend as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>FERNANDINHO\n(MF- MANCHESTER CITY)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fernandinho\nhas been the bedrock of the Manchester City midfield for a while now. This season\nhas been no different as he has admirably shielded his team from opposition\nattacks and his positioning is second to none. He also has a very good range of\npassing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>BERNARDO\nSILVA (MF- MANCHESTER CITY)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernardo\nSilva has proven to be very dependable, whether operating out wide or in\ncentral positions. His ability to wiggle out of tight spaces is uncanny and his\nforward thinking has also been key in Manchester City\u2019s performances this\nseason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>CHRISTIAN\nERIKSEN (MF- TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nDanish midfielder has been one of the more consistent players for Tottenham and\nin the Premier League. His ability to pick out a good pass is quite admirable\nand he has amassed 7 goals and 12 assists \u2013 one of the highest- so far this\nseason. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>EDEN\nHAZARD (FW- CHELSEA)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden\nHazard has been the only reason (more or less) why Chelsea still has anything\nto look forward to at this late stage of the season. Chelsea\u2019s season may be\nregarded as easily forgettable. For the Belgian international, this has been\narguably his most memorable seasons: constantly scoring, assisting and getting\naround defenders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>SERGIO\nAGUERO: (FW- MANCHESTER CITY)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergio\nAguero has notched so many vital goals \u2013 see most recent goal against Burnley-\nthat has kept Manchester City on course to win the treble. He also had\nconsecutive hat-tricks against Arsenal and Chelsea. The 30-year old is one of\nthe most dependable forwards the Premier League has ever seen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>RAHEEM\nSTERLING (FW- MANCHESTER CITY)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\nhas been the season that Sterling has proven all his doubters wrong as he has\nraised his game \u2013 especially this season- to the point where calling him the\nbest player of the Premier League season would not be met with raised eyebrows.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The PFA team of the season released a couple of days ago generated a lot of controversy (inevitably) seeing as a number of players had been omitted and some other players added.
