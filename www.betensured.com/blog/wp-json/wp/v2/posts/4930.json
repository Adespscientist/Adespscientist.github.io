These teams get the added\nbenefit of another year playing together at international level, while also\nseeing their players get another year of domestic football under their belts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams like England will really benefit from\nthis, the 2022 World Cup was their man target, having this competition in 2021\npushes it closer to that and when the management team believe they will be at\ntheir peak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany are undergoing a big overhaul with\nnew players coming in to replace older veterans who are retiring from\ninternational football. Another year together will only help bring them forward\ntoo. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is these teams that people with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newbettingoffers.co.uk\/\">betting account offers<\/a> should be\ntargeting for their Euro 2020 bets, especially those that were already fancied\nfor 2020, and should be even better in 2021, like England.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the teams who are losers,\nlook for established teams who have everything geared towards winning now, and\nalso teams that have had recent success. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two that stick out here are Portugal and\nFrance. The Portuguese team won the Nations League final in 2019, a perfect win\nand preparation for Euro 2020. However, the gap between that and the new Euro\n2020 dates is almost two years, all momentum has been lost. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of the Portuguese players are\ncoming towards the end of their career, including Cristiano Ronaldo, who leads\nthe team, so the longer gap does not help them in terms of their squad age too.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>France entered a golden period in 2016,\nwhen they were supposed to win Euro 2016 in their home country. They didn\u2019t but\nmade amends when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sport\/football\/44754965\">winning\nthe 2018 World Cup in Russia<\/a>. The Euro 2020 competition was their next\ntarget, but that has been pushed back a year and doesn\u2019t help them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>France may not be ageing like Portugal, but their opponents will gain more from the additional year to prepare than France will, a team already prepared and ready to win. Whether you follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/\">football tips<\/a> or look for selections yourself, moving the European Championships back a year is going to help and hinder some teams. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All eyes on what should be a fascinating\nsummer of football in 2021.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Will the Year Delay Affect Teams at Euro 2020?
