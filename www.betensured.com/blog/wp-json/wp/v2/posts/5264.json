The season was quite unusual, to say the least, although it was among the most competitive seasons with nine different teams dominating the league at different times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manchester City finished as the season champions, after displaying an incredible run which got them 21 straight wins between December and March in all their competitions. West Brom, Sheffield, and Fulham ended their campaign in the relegation zone in a season where fans were missed in stadiums. Fortunately, the end of one season signals the beginning of another, and Betway punters are excited about the prospects of wagering on the upcoming 2021\/2022 EPL season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When is the 2021\/2022 EPL Season Kick-Off?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming 2021\/2022 EPL campaign will kick off on Saturday, 14<sup>th<\/sup> August 2021, with the opening match coming only a month after the Euro final game. That means some players will only rest for a few weeks before the beginning of the season. Fortunately, fans are set to be welcomed back in stadiums, and fixture congestion will be less frequent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next season is promising to be another exciting installment of England\u2019s top flight, with the final matchday set to come exactly after a year. As such, Betway <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betway.co.zm\/sport\/soccer\">live soccer betting<\/a> enthusiasts can expect to wager on games until game week 38, set to happen on Sunday 22<sup>nd<\/sup> May 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When Will The 2021\/2022 EPL Fixtures Get Announced?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2021\/2022 Premier League campaign fixtures are set to be announced on Wednesday 16<sup>th<\/sup> June 2021. Newly Promoted Watford and Norwich City plus either Swansea City or Brentford will be facing all the teams alongside the usual culprits, with the dates for the highly-anticipated London derbies confirmed too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which Teams Will Participate For The 2021\/2022 Season?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming 2021\/2022 Premier League season will feature 20 teams, with three newly promoted teams replacing the relegated teams (West Brom, Fulham, and Sheffield). Watford and Norwich have already booked a spot in the campaign after securing automatic qualification from the Championship. The two will be joined by the team that wins the Championship playoffs, with competing teams including Burnley, Swansea City, and Bournemouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three relegated EPL teams won\u2019t compete in the upcoming 2021\/2022 season and will be playing against other Championship teams. However, Newcastle United, Burnley, and Sheffield United will have another shot at the EPL campaign after managing to avoid the drop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When Will The Summer Transfer Window Start And End?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The English Premier League organizers have announced that the next summer transfer window will remain open till the end of August. According to a recent statement on the upcoming season, the summer transfer window is set to remain open for 12 weeks, starting from 9<sup>th<\/sup> June and close on 31<sup>st<\/sup> August at 23:00 BST. That will align with other leagues in Europe, offering plenty of opportunities to wager while watching the games live in stadiums and from broadcasts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the 2020\/2021 EPL season officially coming to a close, the top-four spots and relegation battles have been decided, and the stage is set for the 2021\/2022 season.
