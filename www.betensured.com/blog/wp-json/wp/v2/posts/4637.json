This is\nnow 1001 days since Liverpool lost at Anfield. We do not even want to do the\nmathematics on this one. The only recent thing about this Liverpool side in the\npast few games was the fact that they have been unable to finish teams when\nthey had chances. Liverpool is 16 points from second \u2013 Manchester City in case\nyou think it is Leicester \u2013 and still have a game in hand. Something\ninexplicable would have to happen at Anfield for them not to win this trophy.\nAfter 30 years!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Manchester United, the simple fact is\nthat Rashford was missed. With all the money that has been spent in the past,\nthat is a very surprising statement to make. A lot of these players are not\ngood enough to play in this Club and that is the bitter truth at Old Trafford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Bundesliga opens with a flurry..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stand-out game over the weekend was\nobviously the one that Dortmund played in. A certain 19-year old came on in the\nsecond half- Manchester United, you remember him? &#8211; and had 3 goals in a very\nshort period. (We got information that in Germany, a hat-trick is scored only\nwhen the goals are scored in the first half and there are no goals scored in\nbetween the three goals). Erling Haaland, what a way to start a career in\nGermany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RB Leipzig had to come from behind to\nmaintain top spot. Timo Werner, their talisman, bagged a brace and is looking\nlike the real deal now. The only question right now is if they can keep up the\nmomentum till the end of the season and become champions of Germany, especially\nwith Bayern Munich not letting up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Serie A taking shape.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inter Milan could only manage a draw,\nJuventus took full advantage and Lazio, who are on an eleven-game winning\nstreak thrashed Sampdoria and could move ahead of Inter Milan with a game in\nhand. Juventus would have to dig deep to get to the finish line. Zlatan\nIbrahimovic did not score for AC Milan. However, it is not just a coincidence\nthat AC Milan started winning games shortly after signing Zlatan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Barcelona wins under new Management..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barcelona may not have won by a lot of\ngoals, but there was a bit of improvement under Quique Setien. This may a bit\nearly to judge but there will have to be some adjustments especially after Luis\nSuarez underwent an operation. How Ernesto Valverde was sacked may be up for\ndebate but this Barcelona squad would have to step up quickly because their\nrivals, Real Madrid, are not letting up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Liverpool cannot be stopped..
