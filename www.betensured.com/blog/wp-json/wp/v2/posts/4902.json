You\u2019re in the\nright place. In this guide, you\u2019ll gather relevant information to improve your\nfootball wagering on online betting platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betway.com.gh\/\">Betway sports betting<\/a>&nbsp;and help you profit from it. Please read the guide in its\nentirety for it to work well for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understand the Basics&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start\nbetting on football, it would be best to understand the basics. Many beginners\noverlook the basics, but they are essential for your success. It would help if\nyou learned the things involved with placing bets on football.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from\nunderstanding the basics of football betting, you must know some basics of\nfootball also. Find out the leagues that exist and the teams in each one of\nthem. Learn about the key players and team performances in the current\nseason.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learn the Different Types of Football Bets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You must understand the\nunique types of bets you can place on football. Although you\u2019ll not use all of\nthem, it is important to understand the basics of each. In football betting,\ntwo types of bets are most common. They are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Point Spreads<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 a point spread\nis a handicap that you use to come up with a 50\/50 betting plan. Here, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/bookmaking-gambling\">bookmaker<\/a> offers a point spread\nfor the competing teams in the match. For instance, one team could have -2.5\nwhile the other has a +2.5. The team with the -2.5 will have 2.5 points subtracted\nfrom their final score. For you to win a wager on them, they must win by over\nthree points.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Totals&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013 on these bets, a\nbookmaker like Betway offers an expected total for the point both teams will\nscore. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=punter\">a punter<\/a>, you\u2019ll decide whether\nto bet on the under or over. If you select over, you win if the combined score\nis higher than set by the bookmakers and vice-versa.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other types of football\nbets you should know include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Moneylines&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013 Moneyline bets are\nsimple. The odds depend on each team\u2019s relative probability of winning.<\/li><li><strong>Props<\/strong>&#8211; with prop bets, you\nwager on the results in a game that is not necessarily the final result. For\ninstance, you can wager on the first team to score.<\/li><li><strong>Futures<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in the futures\nbet, you place a bet on how teams or players will perform throughout the\nseason, for example, wagering on a team to win the league.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Parlays&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013 With parlays, you can\nbet on multiple football games. The payouts are usually attractive, but all the\nteams must win. The risk in parlays is much higher.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Know Where You Can Place Football Bets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After learning the\nbasics of football and football betting types, it is time to place the bets.\nThe big question is \u2013 where can you place football bets? You have several\noptions, but you should select the one that is available in your region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Casino Sportsbooks<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Several casinos\nusually have a sportsbook which features gigantic screens showing live games.\nThey also have digital odds boards showing all the current odds. You can either\nbet on the counter with a human cashier or on interactive machines.<\/li><li><strong>Bookmaking Shops<\/strong>&#8211; These are similar to\nsportsbooks, but they are not in casinos. They also have several screens\nshowing matches with counters where you can place your bets.<\/li><li><strong>Telephone Betting<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Many bookmakers\noffer telephone betting options. You\u2019ll call the bookmaker and let them know\nyour bets and confirm the odds then give your Credit Card Details to pay.<\/li><li><strong>Online Sports Betting<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 This is\narguably the best way to place football bets. It is very convenient and\navailable too. There are several online sports betting sites like Betway that\nyou can join and start placing your bets.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Have a Dedicated Budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a budget and\nfollowing it strictly is essential in your gambling endeavors. Set aside some\nmoney that is exclusively for football betting and plan how you\u2019ll use it.\nDecide the percentage of the available funds you\u2019ll use for each bet. Never use\nmoney meant for other essential things in your home or workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bottom Line<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When starting, have\nsimple objectives like having fun as you learn then revise them as you become\nmore experienced. Don\u2019t rush into chasing profits before you understand how\nfootball betting works. Have a betting strategy that will guide you. You can\nalso join betting communities online to learn from the experiences of other\npunters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you new to sports betting and would like to improve your football betting tips?
