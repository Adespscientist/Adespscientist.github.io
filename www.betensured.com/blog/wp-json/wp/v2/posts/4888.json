However, without\nhaving the technology in place none of it would be possible. It is the\ndevelopment of technology that is the leading factor in the increasing\npopularity of gambling in Nigeria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payment systems, especially on mobile\ndevices had long been a problem in Nigeria. Mobile payments simply failed to\ncapture the attention of the Nigerian public in the same way they were in other\nAfrican countries, such as Kenya. There are many reasons why Nigerians were not\nusing the internet to make payments, including slow Internet connections and\nthe threat of online fraud. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, things have changed\nsignificantly over the past few years and you only have to look at the comments\nof Seun Anibaba, the CEO of Lagos State Lotteries Board. Speaking about online\npayment methods, Anibaba said, \u201cWe have seen significant growth in the number\nof payment solutions that are available. All that is definitely changing the\ngaming space,\u201d before continuing, \u201cThe operators will go with whoever is\nfaster, whoever can connect to their platform with less issues and glitches.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is not there are now plenty\nof domestic online payment methods that are trusted by those using gambling\nwebsites. With the increase in the number of trusted payment solutions, betting\nwebsites started to offer their services in Nigeria including Betway, one of\nthe leading online gambling brands in the world. Betway had already opened\ntheir business to customers in other African countries including Ghana and\nSouth Africa. However, the lack of trusted payment methods and secure internet\nconnections saw them delay their online opening in Nigeria but thankfully they\nare now in business in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/bettingguide.com\/ng\/betting\/best-betting-sites\">Compare the best Nigerian betting sites on BettingGuide.com<\/a>  and here you will see the wealth of options currently available. Betway has clearly become one of the leading brands in Nigeria but other online gambling options include 22Bet, Wazobet, Bet9ja, and Bet365.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the technology in place, it was only\ngoing to be a matter of time before online gambling took off in Nigeria. This\nis a country that is hugely passionate about football, with the English Premier\nLeague being among the favourite competitions to watch for Nigerian football\nfans. Therefore, many fans would like to have a bet on the Premier League and\nother major football competitions and matches around the world. The Nigerian\npublic have long been held back due to the poor Internet services and payment\noptions but that has all changed and, as a result, so has the number of people\ngambling online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You only have to look at the number of specialist online gambling websites created in Nigeria, plus the introduction of those from abroad, to see how popular betting has become in the country.
