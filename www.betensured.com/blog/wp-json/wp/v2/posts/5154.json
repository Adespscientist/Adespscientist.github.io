The Northern Irishman, who can basically play anywhere Marcelo Bielsa asks him to, is just as pivotal in the Yorkshire side\u2019s XI as any other of their star players, and that was evident in Leeds\u2019 shock 2-1 win over top-of-the-table Manchester City at the Etihad last Saturday afternoon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the run of play, Dallas fired the visitors into the lead just before half-time with his low-driven effort deflecting in off Ederson\u2019s near post. With Leeds\u2019 captain Liam Cooper shown a straight red card before the break, and Ferran Torres eventually finding an equaliser for Man City, who are the favourites in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paddypower.com\/football\/english-premier-league?tab=outrights\">English Premier League title odds<\/a>, many would have thought that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side would go on to win the match from there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the 91<sup>st<\/sup> minute, Dallas latched onto a through ball from Ezgjan Alioski, held off the challenge of in-form defender John Stones, and showed immense composure to slide his shot through the legs of Ederson. We\u2019re sure as Dallas raced towards goal, Leeds fans up and down the country would have preferred it be one of their attackers on the ball. However, it was a finish that most Premier League strikers would have been proud of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those goals were the 29-year-old\u2019s sixth and seventh strikes of the season, a record goal tally in a league campaign for the Northern Irishman in a Leeds shirt. Four of those have come from outside the box, meaning no player in the Premier League has scored from outside the area more than Dallas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leeds boss Bielsa was quick to heap praise on the Northern Ireland international afterwards, claiming that Dallas has been able to show parts of his game this season in the Premier League that many didn\u2019t know he had his in locker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt gave me great happiness for him,\u201d the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.leeds-live.co.uk\/sport\/leeds-united\/marcelo-bielsa-every-word-city-20360733\">Argentine coach said<\/a> when asked how he felt when Dallas netted the winner. \u201cBecause he&#8217;s a player whose game is based a lot on generosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe is a player who helps all his team-mates to recover the ball and to not lose it. And the goal gives a lot of shine to whoever manages to score it. For him to have scored two goals is normally an anomaly. It&#8217;s deserved, it&#8217;s comforting, it&#8217;s good. And this year has allowed Dallas to show a part of himself that we didn&#8217;t know he had.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dallas moved to Brentford from Belfast-based Crusaders in 2012 before joining Leeds in 2015, and adapting to the Premier League after spending most of your professional career in the Championship, especially at 29, is no easy feat and many have struggled to do so in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you probably wouldn\u2019t have blamed Leeds had they sold Dallas back to a Championship side in favour of bringing someone in with a bit of experience in the top-flight. That is something Dallas\u2019 former international teammate Oliver Norwood had to deal with on two occasions, as he helped both Brighton and Hove Albion and Fulham get promoted before returning to the Championship without a crack at the Premier League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Leeds stuck with Dallas, who had been loyal to the side in their quest for top flight football for five years, and their choice to do so has paid dividends. The 29-year-old, who started as a winger before moving into full-back and can now play as a midfielder, is crucial to how they line up and it seems, like a fine wine, he is only getting better with age!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When pundits and Leeds United fans analyse a rather successful first season back in the Premier League after some 16 years in the lower regions of English football, it will likely be Patrick Bamford and summer signing Raphinha that are basking in the praise, and rightly so with Bamford\u2019s 14 goals so far this season [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.9 -
