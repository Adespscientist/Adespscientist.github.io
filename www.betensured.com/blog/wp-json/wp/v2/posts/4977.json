If there is one thing that Tottenham has shown in the past one week, it is the fact that they are quite efficient in scoring goals. Five minutes later, they were ahead. There were obviously some shambolic defending from the very expensive Manchester United backline and Tottenham kept piling the pressure even before Martial was unfairly sent off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Manchester United, they have not had an impressive outing in the first three Premier League games and are already behind a lot of teams. Solskjaer has his work cut out especially this season as there is very little room for excuses anymore. It is a strange thing when your team concedes six goals and is still not the main talk of the weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Tottenham, scoring more than 5 goals three times already this season is no mean feat as the team has shown its efficiency in front of goal even with the unavailability of Gareth Bale. Mourinho and Tottenham still have a lot of work to do as the games against Everton and Newcastle was a bit lethargic but things seem to be coming together for them now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Merciless Aston Villa..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aston Villa seemed to know just how to play against Liverpool. Admittedly, the first goal scored by Aston Villa was as a result of Adrian\u2019s error \u2013 at least we see why he is the backup goal keeper now- but it just seemed that Dean Smith and his team had a plan to take advantage of Liverpool\u2019s high line. The ability of players like Grealish and now Barkley to exploit spaces was a huge concern for Liverpool and they eventually shipped in 7 goals. Aston Villa, the team that just scraped relegation are currently unbeaten in the League after crushing the defending champions. Dean Smith could not have asked for a better start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Liverpool, the high line had always been a concern but there seemed to be some ineffectiveness with the pressing which led to Aston Villa being able to get the ball to the likes of Grealish who took control of the game. The loss of Sadio Mane was a huge blow as Salah could not do everything on his own. Jurgen Klopp and his gang would have to shake this off and come back stronger after the international break to face the in-form team in the league and in Merseyside: Everton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Atalanta blazing the trail again..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gasperini\u2019s team does not know how to not score goals. This team is arguably the most entertaining team in the whole of Europe as anyone can get in dangerous positions and score goals. Scoring four or more goals in consecutive games is no mean feat, especially when you consider that they played against a Lazio side that was in contention of winning the Serie A last season and dispatched them with ease. They are stealing every neutral\u2019s hearts again. Can they go all the way this time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Barcelona drop points..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing against Julen Lopetegui\u2019s Sevilla side, a team that has not lost a game in 8 months was never going to be easy. Ultimately, they showed great character by coming back into the game almost immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Sevilla, the Europa League winners, they are currently a difficult team to beat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entertaining game, but both teams share the spoils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Juventus versus Napoli cancelled..<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Napoli team could not travel to Turin to play the mighty Juventus because two of their players tested positive to corona virus. The initial feedback was that the game would be forfeited by Napoli as Juventus still showed up to play which was a bit strange as Napoli had claimed to have already communicated their inability to travel. The teams would have to go at it some other time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Manchester United mauled at Old Trafford..
