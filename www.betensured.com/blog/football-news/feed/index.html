										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The drive for clubs to succeed in
the second half of the season is in full swing with only a few months left on
the top European football calendar. In all honesty, it has been a subdued January transfer window with most clubs having a preference
for the summer window. Borussia Dortmund got a potentially sweet deal when they
acquired the highly rated Erling Haaland who has already bagged seven goals in
three matches.</p>



<p>The Premier League has been on a
winter break, the first of its kind in an updated system of reforms to keep the
league fresh and interesting. Speaking of interesting, who ever thought that
Liverpool would be this dominant? Last season, they were good, really good in
fact. However, they have grown and evolved to be an unstoppable force. 24 wins
from 25 matches are truly astonishing. This season, they have taken all comers,
with the only glitch being held to a frustrating draw at Old Trafford by
Manchester United. The Manchester based club made some moves in the January
window in a bid to salvage their season. Bruno Fernandez was the highest
profile signing in the Premier League, joining United in a deal worth around
55m Euros (£47m) but add-ons could as well increase the overall cost to 80m
euros (£67.7m). They also added Nigerian international Odion Ighalo on loan
from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua who reportedly took a pay cut to put on a
United shirt.</p>



<p>United next visit Stamford Bridge to
face rivals Chelsea. Both teams have played young players in their matches.
Surprisingly, bookies from William
Hill fancy the Blues to win this one and that is why they have Chelsea
at 1.83 to win against United’s 4.33. United have won 3 of the last 5 meetings
between the two sides, the last being a 2-1 win in a cup tie. 12BET have an
amazing deal for new players only. The first step is to place 6 bets each with
a minimum stake of £10. If any of the 6 qualifying bets is over £35 it will
only count as the £35 maximum and count towards 1 of the 6 qualifying bets.</p>



<p>Football and sports generally have
transcended the gamer experience. Many fans and gamers alike are in a position
to take chance on various sports that they fancy. They may not be able to play
the game, but they can join in the action from behind the scenes. This aspect
of gaming has been a global phenomenon for example, the <a href="https://newzealandcasinos.nz/casino-games/online-pokies/">best online pokies by nz
casinos</a> give gamers a chance to learn the craft and grow their winnings. </p>



<p>Maybe you want to explore the thrill
of gaming in a simple way, <a href="https://casinopro.se/casino-spel">casino games in Sweden</a> is a good
first step. For the ultimate experience in gaming diversity, you could explore <a href="http://www.elitcasinon.com/">ElitCasinon best online list</a>. Speaking
of diversity, the Premier League clubs moved to ensure that the next summer
transfer window will close on September 1st. They voted to revert to this
system because of the need to give teams more time to get deals over the line.
The recent two summer windows have seen some clubs run out of time, as it would
close at mid-August latest. With profitability at its highest due to TV rights
deals, it remains to be seen whether or not this will help English football
clubs get more players in. Traditional heavyweights Manchester United and
Arsenal are no longer the attractive destinations they used to be due to
performances.</p>



<p>League leaders Liverpool are on
cloud nine as they march towards a first Premier League title in 30 years. No
team this season seems to have an answer for them. As of the Premier League
winter break, the Merseyside club had notched an astonishing 24 wins from 25
matches. After the 2-0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur in their last match, Pep
Guardiola admitted that Liverpool are unstoppable and conceded defeat in the
race for the title.</p>



<p>Can this side get even better? Well in football, there is always room for improvement. In their case, Liverpool indeed can add more fire power with none of their front three being out and out strikers. There have been reports of Kylian Mbappe possibly joining the Reds in the future. However, the stumbling block in such a move which has a huge price tag is that Liverpool would have to let go of their biggest name; Mohammed Salah.</p>

<p>Chalk this up as a North London derby classic with lots of goals and a lot of spirit. Arsenal was in control for most of the early stages but were losing at half-time (that is yet another loss/draw at half-time for the gunners). In previous years, heads may have gone down and Tottenham would have easily buried the game. Unai Emery played his hands early by making two substitutions (credit to him) and both players had a role to play in Arsenal’s comeback. For Tottenham, the decision to play Juan Foyth ahead of Toby Alderweireld is completely baffling especially considering the fact that Jan Vertonghen is just returning from injury and is still gaining fitness. Their defending was not what we have come to expect from Tottenham with Foyth being poor for Lacazzette’s goal and then Vertonghen getting sent off later on. Arsenal seems to have a different attitude especially when playing the big teams. Up next for Arsenal, Manchester United.</p>

<p>Another derby over in Merseyside in which the game looked like it was going to end in a stalemate (Van Dijk thought so as well) until Jordan Pickford mistimed the flight of the ball and allowed Divok Origi (yes, you saw that correctly) nod into an empty post in the last minute of the game. Everton seems to have improved and had Andre Gomez scored with his header from six yards, the game would have turned out differently (by score-line, definitely). Liverpool went with all three points. They have not had their players firing on all cylinders yet but are unbeaten and no matter what they do, they are still two points behind Manchester City.</p>

<p>Manchester United had to show some steel to come back from two-goals down (again) and go in level in the first half. After the restart, it was expected that they would continue from where they left off but shocking, it seemed like the attacking threats just dried up. Another two points dropped for the Red Devils. They keep slipping away from the top four.</p>
<p><strong><em>Real Madrid and Barcelona back in winning ways.</em></strong></p>

<p>For Real Madrid, it was really important that they got back to winning ways after their terrible performance last weekend. They were assured in possession and the absence of Marcelo meant that most of their attacks came from the Dani Carvajal, who ran the right channel excellently and was involved in both goals. Real Madrid still fifth, five points behind leaders Barcelona, who took advantage of slip-ups from Sevilla and Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>PSV’s winning streak came to an end over the weekend as a resilient Feyenoord team ensured that PSV went home with nothing. Feyenoord bossed the first half and scored twice (could have been more). In the second half, PSV had chances to level the game but some poor choices and poor finishing meant that they left with nothing. PSV still top of the league, with Ajax hot on their tails.</p>
<p><strong><em>PSG finally drops points..</em></strong></p>

<p>Paris St Germain finally dropped its first points in 15 games after their entertaining 2-2 draw against Bordeaux. PSG took the lead twice and were pegged back by a very determined Bordeaux side. Nothing to be worried about as they still hold a handsome 14-point lead over second placed Montpellier who happened to beat sorry Monaco.</p>
<p><strong><em>The slump continues for Monaco..</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another week, another low for Monaco. Right now, it does not seem like Thierry Henry can get this team out of this rot. Admittedly, there are still loads of injuries but this Monaco team does not have  structure or cohesion, giving away two goals in the final ten minutes of the game after taking the lead. More work needs to be done, and fast, else the teams above would continue to drift away.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, all the attention has been from whether Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool can finally win the elusive Premier League (or even go the whole season unbeaten) to whether Maurizio Sarri’s “Sarri-ball” will take a long while for the Chelsea players to adapt to (it clearly hasn’t) to whether Eden Hazard is the best player in the Premier League and if he can score 40 goals this season to the Manchester United-Jose Mourinho-Paul Pogba fiasco and obviously their recent defeat to West Ham. Nobody has paid much attention to Manchester City recently (and that is a great plus for them) considering the fact that they won the League last season, breaking a number of records along the way. Over the weekend, they went about their business and are currently top of the League, easily beating Brighton and Hove Albion and not conceding in their last two games. The question now is, will they come back down now that they are up?</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United, oh Manchester </strong></p>

<p>The signs were there before today. Nobody seemed confident that they would win this game, considering that West Ham were picking up steam after being on the losing end of their first four premier league games. Alexis Sanchez did not make the 18-man squad. Manchester United did not disappoint, and were unsurprisingly beaten 3-1. Manchester United cannot slip up anymore this season. No more errors.</p>
<p><strong>The Chelsea-Liverpool rematch still does not disappoint.</strong></p>

<p>After the mid-week Carabao cup where these two teams met, we wanted more of the same as the likes of Hazard, Salah, Firmino and Giroud started. They did not disappoint. There was some sub-par finishing (I’m looking at you Hazard and Salah) but the score-line was even based on the balance of play. Liverpool (and Daniel Sturridge) had to pull a rabbit out of a hat to snatch a point after some poor finishing. Both sides have lots of quality players and play some quality football but their forwards need to be more clinical in order to be in contention in the long run. Hazard alone cannot score all the goals as Giroud and Morata have a combined one goal (Granit Xhaka has the same number alone), the Liverpool front three have not been sharp as well.</p>
<p><strong>Juventus cannot be stopped.</strong></p>

<p>In their biggest Serie A game of the season, Juventus made a very resounding statement. Ronaldo, their most influential player, had a hand in all three goals but did not score. He was still the best player on the pitch. Napoli on the other hand, put themselves about but you just get the feeling that they can only push Juventus so far. After seven games, Juventus is currently six points ahead. Who is stopping them now?</p>
<p><strong>Bayern Munich slip up and Dortmund take full advantage..</strong></p>

<p>If you thought that the Bundesliga was done and dusted before the season started, think again. Bayern Munich was shockingly poor on Friday against Hertha Berlin and were duly beaten. Dortmund were set up to take advantage but were two goals down in no time. They had to dig deep and score four goals. Dortmund is quite poor defensively but know how to score goals, but how long can they keep that up for. Still, credit should go to Lucien Favre for blooding these young players. Dortmund is top of the League.</p>
<p><strong>Draws in the Madrid Derby and for Barcelona..</strong></p>

<p>The Madrid derby was a bit disappointing over the weekend. Atletico Madrid would be the happier of the two sides and this still leaves the La Liga wide open. At the Nou Camp, Barcelona had to come from behind to snatch a draw, with Lionel Messi having to come from the bench to register an assist. Sevilla is the only team to have taken full advantage over the last weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Ronaldo finally breaks his Serie A duck..</strong></p>
<p>Every week, since Ronaldo signed for Juventus, people had been saying that he was due a</p>
<p>goal. On Sunday, the wait was over. Ronaldo bagged a brace in a 2-1 victory against an</p>
<p>unbeaten Sassuolo side. He could easily have had four. That was meant to be the headline</p>
<p>but I guess Douglas Costa was a bit jealous. He elbowed, head-butted and then spat on</p>
<p>Federico Di Francesco’s face. To describe how silly his actions were, Serie A currently uses</p>
<p>VAR, so there was no way he would have gotten away with it. Absolutely shocking. And</p>
<p>stupid.</p>

<p>The Liverpool juggernaut continues…</p>
<p>In arguably the biggest game of the weekend, Liverpool played Tottenham at Wembley. To</p>
<p>say Liverpool deserved to win the game is an understatement. Tottenham looked so</p>
<p>lethargic and lost the ball in very sensitive areas and were extremely lucky to lose by one</p>
<p>goal, no thanks to Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah. Tottenham on the other hand have</p>
<p>not been very convincing so far in as much as they have been able to beat Manchester</p>
<p>United at Old Trafford. Liverpool currently has 5 wins in a row, their best ever start in a very</p>
<p>long time and after scaling their first hurdle in a list of consecutive difficult games, they have</p>
<p>greatly increased their chances of still being in the running of winning their first League Title</p>
<p>in 28 years.</p>

<p>Chelsea picking up steam…</p>
<p>Considering the fact that Chelsea is adjusting to life under new management, they are still</p>
<p>one of the teams to beat this season. Playing great football, getting the best out of their key</p>
<p>players is all that could be ask of. They seem to be the running for the Premier League as</p>
<p>well. Hazard looks like he is having the time of his life at the moment and looks like he will</p>
<p>have his biggest goal return this season.</p>

<p>Arsenal makes it 3-in-3….</p>
<p>Arsenal looked fairly solid against Newcastle but buckled a bit under some pressure towards</p>
<p>the end of the game. Ozil crowned his 200 th appearance with a goal (ultimately, the winning</p>
<p>goal). All in all, credit should go to Emery. To put in context, Unai Emery has won two away</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>games (consecutively if I may add), Wenger won one away game from January till May.</p>
<p>Right direction? I think so.</p>

<p>What is going on in Atletico Madrid?</p>
<p>After the signing of a number of attacking players, most especially Lemar and Gelson</p>
<p>Martins, many of us thought that this could be Atletico’s year considering the fact that they</p>
<p>have always been solid defensively. That has not been the case so far. Before the weekend,</p>
<p>they had played 3, won once, drawn once and lost once. What was most telling was the fact</p>
<p>that they had scored only two goals. Also, their most dependable part of the pitch (defense)</p>
<p>had been committing so many individual errors (see Diego Godin’s slip against Celta Vigo).</p>
<p>This past weekend, a misplaced pass in the middle of the pitch led to them conceding and</p>
<p>having to dig really deep to get a late (very late) equaliser at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
<p>It is still early days but things need to change or they will be looking up at the table in no</p>
<p>time.</p>

<p>Is the Anoeta curse broken.. Real Madrid held at the San Mames?</p>
<p>To put into context: before last season, the last time Barcelona won at the Anoeta was when</p>
<p>Frank Rijkaard was coach. Now, under Valverde, they have made it two in a row. Ousmane</p>
<p>Dembele is gradually becoming a key player in this Barcelona engine. Elsewhere, Real</p>
<p>Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw against Athletic Bilbao at the San Mames. It is still early days</p>
<p>but Real Madrid cannot afford too many slips before the El-Clasico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the madness of this great World Cup is gradually fizzing out, we have decided to take a look at the best performers at this tournament.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium)</strong></p>
<p>Now this could have easily been Hugo Lloris, but for him gifting Mandzukic the Croats&#8217; second goal in the final.</p>
<p>That and he conceded twice in the final and three against a poor Argentina side.</p>
<p><strong>Right Back: Šime Vrsaljko (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>It was between him and Benjamin Pavard of France but he wins it because of his relentless running and forward thinking approach throughout the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Center Back: Rafael Varane (France)</strong></p>
<p>What a year this man is having.</p>
<p>Champions League winner to World Cup winner in a little over 1 month.</p>
<p>He produced some assured and solid displays and also got the crucial opening goal against Uruguay.</p>
<p><strong>Diego Godin (Uruguay)</strong></p>
<p>This was a selection headache between him and Samuel Umtiti.</p>
<p>Godin showed a very high level of calmness and assuredness in the face of danger particularly in the latter stages of the game against Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>Left Back: Lucas Hernandez (France)</strong></p>
<p>For this particular position, he has no competition in this tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Ngolo Kante ( France)</strong></p>
<p>Prior to this tournament, we thought we&#8217;d be putting Toni Kroos on this list.</p>
<p>Again, Kante is in a class of his own.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Luka Modric (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>Started most games slowly but imposed himself as games progressed. Winning the trophy itself was just a step too far. Deserved Golden Ball winner as well.</p>
<p><strong>Central Midfield: Paul Pogba (France)</strong></p>
<p>This is the most consistent that we have seen Pogba post Juventus. He was never over elaborate and was very efficient. Got a good goal in the final as well.</p>
<p><strong>Left Forward: Ivan Perisic (Croatia)</strong></p>
<p>Now this was a tussle between him and Eden Hazard of Belgium.</p>
<p>He gets the nod because he was effective throughout the knock-out stages, also considering that him and his team had to play 3 consecutive extra-time games. Scored three very good goals as well.</p>
<p><strong>Right Forward: Kylian Mbappe (France)</strong></p>
<p>Mr Golden Boy.</p>
<p>Was very brazen and dared to take on defenders when in possession.</p>
<p>Did his fair bit in defending as well.</p>
<p><strong>Center Forward: Romelu Lukaku (Belgium)</strong></p>
<p>If we had our way, we would have played with a false nine and stuck Cheryshev up there for all we cared. It was not a fantastic tournament for number 9s. Harry Kane could have easily been up there by virtue of his six goals but he was practically non-existent after the group games.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>Kindly share your thoughts about your own best eleven at this tournament.</p>
<p>Till later.</p>

<p>Rose was heavily linked with a move to United in the summer transfer window, and although Mourinho was desperate to sign four players in the summer, he only ended up getting three: Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic.</p>
<p>Back in August last year, Rose spoke about his immediate future at Tottenham Hotspur and the 27-year-old didn&#8217;t hold back in an explosive interview.</p>
<p>Rose, who arguably had the best season of his career in 2016/17, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4209426/tottenham-danny-rose-exclusive-wage-worth/">The Sun</a> that he wants &#8220;to play up north&#8221;. He also admitted that &#8220;time is running out&#8221; to win trophies, while suggesting that he wants a pay rise at Spurs.</p>

<p>The defender then went onto admit that he hopes Tottenham make a couple more signings, but &#8220;not players you have to Google and say, &#8216;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Rose told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4209426/tottenham-danny-rose-exclusive-wage-worth/">The Sun</a> in a revealing interview: &#8220;At my age, and having missed six months with injury, I have been thinking about this quite a lot,&#8221; the 27-year-old said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am reaching my peak and have probably only got one big contract left in me. Time is running out and I do want to win trophies. I don&#8217;t want to play football for 15 years and not have one trophy or one medal. Sorry, that&#8217;s not what I am about. I wouldn&#8217;t be happy with that. <a href="https://www.betensured.com">I want to win something</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mourinho has expressed the need for a new left-back and centre midfielder, but as per Miguel Delaney from <i><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/manchester-united-transfer-news-january-targets-shortlist-jose-mourinho-carlos-soler-valencia-a8054046.html">The Independent</a></i>, Mourinho has identified Valencia&#8217;s Carlos Soler as his No.1 transfer target.</p>
<p>Soler, 20, only made his first-team debut just under a year ago but has been integral to Valencia&#8217;s success, making 11 appearances &#8211; scoring once and registering four assists.</p>
<p>His performances have alerted Mourinho and his staff, who feel he could a bit of creativity that United have been bereft of in the absence of record signing Paul Pogba.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gareth Bale was making his first start in three months</p>
<p>Numancia, fifth in Spain&#8217;s second division, had Pape Maly Diamanka sent-off on the hour mark.</p>
<p>Isco then scored another penalty and Borja Mayoral headed in a late third.</p>
<p>Bale has been restricted to just six appearances in La Liga this season because of injuries.</p>
<p>Real will look to secure a quarter-final place next Wednesday, but holders Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Celta Vigo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Marseille have suspended Patrice Evra after he kicked a fan in the head before his side&#8217;s Europa League defeat at Vitoria Guimaraes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Footage showed the 36-year-old former Manchester United defender aiming an acrobatic kick at a supporter at the side of the pitch during the warm-up.</p>
<p>Evra will be interviewed before any disciplinary action is decided.</p>
<p>A Marseille statement also condemned the &#8220;unacceptable behaviour&#8221; by a &#8220;handful of provocateurs&#8221;.</p>
<p>European football&#8217;s governing body Uefa charged France international Evra with violent conduct earlier on Friday, with the full-back suspended for &#8220;at least one game&#8221;.</p>
<p>French newspaper L&#8217;Equipe<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external"></i> reported that Marseille supporters had been jeering Evra for about half an hour while the players prepared for the game, which the Ligue 1 side lost 1-0.</p>
<p>The player had gone over to the fans to talk to them &#8211; but the situation escalated.</p>
<p>Evra, who was named as a substitute, was dismissed before kick-off, and Marseille began the game with 11 players.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a professional and experienced player, Patrice Evra could not respond in such an inappropriate way,&#8221; the statement added.<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external"></i></p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the first results of the internal investigation conducted by the club reveal unacceptable behaviour on the part of a handful of provocateurs who uttered particularly serious hateful attacks against the player, even though the latter and his team-mates warmed up for an important game.&#8221;</p>
<p>His former Manchester United team-mate, Mikael Silvestre, told BBC Sport that Evra had &#8220;no future&#8221; at Marseille, but that the incident would not be the end of his career.</p>
<div id="story-body" class="story-body sp-story-body gel-body-copy">
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">How it happened</h3>
<ul>
<li>Named as a substitute, Evra begins warming up with his team-mates before the game</li>
<li>The former Manchester United left-back appears to be the target of songs and abuse from the crowd for about 30 minutes</li>
<li>Evra approaches the Marseille fans, about 500 of whom had travelled to Guimaraes</li>
<li>He volleys a ball towards the crowd, but some of his team-mates come over and look to calm the defender down</li>
<li>Evra climbs over the billboards and looks to confront spectators who have come towards the front of the stand</li>
<li>The 36-year-old returns to the pitch, but a group of fans approach the billboards and Evra appears to kick one of them</li>
<li>Evra is led away to the substitutes&#8217; bench, but is sent off by the referee and watches the game from the stands</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">Analysis</h3>
<p><i>Julien Laurens, French football expert</i></p>
<p>It is really sad. Patrice Evra is 36, he has got two children. He has played five Champions League finals, a Euro final, won lots of titles and this is probably the last few weeks of his career &#8211; it is really sad this is how he is going to end.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t abuse your own player &#8211; the abuse from the fans was targeted only at Evra &#8211; but Evra should never have responded the way he did.</p>
<p>It has been really tough for him since the beginning of the season. He lost his place in the team, he has been really poor every time he played, and I think he just couldn&#8217;t take the jeers, the abuse.</p>
<p>There were a lot of insults, but the fans were also saying stuff like: &#8220;You&#8217;re rubbish, go home. Keep doing your videos, but stop playing football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way they insulted him and his family &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t justify his reaction &#8211; but you can see why he got frustrated.</p>
<p>He is 100%. He says things like they are, he reacts the way they are. He says there are no fibs with him, so you get it as he says it or as he does it. Sometimes he should think a bit more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Chelsea became the first English team to lose a Champions League game this season as they were well beaten by a clinical Roma.</p>
<p>The Blues would have progressed with a victory, but trailed within 39 seconds when Edin Dzeko flicked Aleksandar Kolarov&#8217;s cross down to Stephan El Shaarawy, who smashed home from 25 yards.</p>
<p>Alvaro Morata missed a huge chance to equalise from close range, and El Shaarawy made it 2-0 when ex-Roma defender Antonio Rudiger failed to deal with Radja Nainggolan&#8217;s long ball forward.</p>
<p>Chelsea had more shots &#8211; 14 to 13 &#8211; but were three behind when Diego Perotti cracked home from 20 yards after Blues defenders failed to close him down.</p>
<p>Roma should have led 4-0 when Chelsea&#8217;s defenders all ran to Dzeko, who managed to square to a totally unmarked Perotti, but he fired over when he should have finished.</p>
<p>The Blues were hugely fortunate that Atletico Madrid&#8217;s failure to beat Qarabag &#8211; their game in the Spanish capital ended 1-1 &#8211; means Chelsea are still likely to qualify for the last 16 from Group C.</p>
<p>Antonio Conte&#8217;s side are four points above third-placed Atletico &#8211; and a win in their next Champions League game at Qarabag (17:00 GMT on Wednesday, 22 November) will take them through.</p>
<p>Roma, who are fifth in Serie A, now lead the group by a point.</p>

<div class="sp-media-asset__image gel-responsive-image">Stephan El Shaarawy took advantage of a defensive mix-up to double Roma&#8217;s lead</div>
</div>
</figure>
<p>Chelsea had hoped midfielder N&#8217;Golo Kante would be able to return from the hamstring injury which has kept him out for a month, but he did not feel fully fit and was left out.</p>
<p>And how the Blues missed him. David Luiz started in midfield in the reverse game &#8211; a 3-3 draw at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago &#8211; but played in defence at the Stadio Olimpico. Centre-back Gary Cahill replaced Davide Zappacosta from Saturday&#8217;s win over Bournemouth, meaning a reshuffle with Cesar Azpilicueta moving to the right.</p>
<p>They actually should have been 1-0 up within 21 seconds &#8211; when Pedro shot straight at Alisson Becker &#8211; before El Shaarawy scored the sixth quickest Champions League goal of the past decade, following good work from ex-City pair Kolarov and Dzeko.</p>
<p>Chelsea had plenty of shots &#8211; but rarely looked like scoring, with the lively Hazard forcing two saves and shooting wide. Morata also missed a sitter and Marcos Alonso forced a good diving save with an effort from the corner of the box.</p>
<p>But the Blues were error-ridden at the back. They should have conceded when Luiz made a mistake on the halfway line and El Shaarawy played in Dzeko, whose shot was saved.</p>
<p>They trailed 2-0 when Rudiger, a summer signing from the Italian side, let Nainggolan&#8217;s pass bounce and El Shaarawy took advantage to score past the onrushing Thibaut Courtois.</p>
<p>Things did not improve when Antonio Conte brought on Willian for captain Cahill, moving Pedro to the right &#8211; and the Spaniard let Perotti go past him with no other defenders shutting the Argentine down before he smashed in the third.</p>
<p>They were lucky not to concede again with defending resembling football seen on five-a-side pitches &#8211; or school yards &#8211; across the world. All three Chelsea centre-backs ran to Dzeko &#8211; with two men free in the centre but Perotti got it wrong.</p>
<p>Courtois denied Kostas Manolas&#8217; header with a good reaction save as Chelsea were just glad to get off the pitch at the end.</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Morata had another disappointing evening in front of goal.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Spain forward, a £60m summer signing from Real Madrid, had scored seven goals in his first eight games in English football.</p>
<p>But it is now six games in a row without scoring and he was replaced by Michy Batshuayi with 15 minutes left.</p>
<p>At 1-0, he missed a glorious chance to score. Kolarov&#8217;s clearance hit Pedro and landed at Morata&#8217;s feet six yards out. The Spaniard was not expecting the ball and blazed well over.</p>
<p>He only had two shots on a quiet night &#8211; dragging a shot wide from just outside the box after a one-two with Hazard.</p>
<p>Former England defender Phil Neville &#8211; at the Stadio Olimpico for BBC Radio 5 live &#8211; said: &#8220;Morata missed two really good chances at Bournemouth on the weekend and he&#8217;s not scored for five games [before today].</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wonder if his confidence has been knocked. He had to score that.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>Could Morata be in danger of losing his place for Sunday&#8217;s Premier League game against Manchester United at 16:30 GMT? Roma go to Fiorentina at 14:00 GMT that day.</p>
<h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">Man of the match &#8211; Aleksandar Kolarov (Roma)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The other 16 games involving English clubs in this season&#8217;s Champions League have seen them win 12 and draw four.</li>
<li>Chelsea are now winless in their past six away games against Italian clubs in the Champions League (D1 L5).</li>
<li>This was only the third time that Chelsea have lost a Champions League game by a margin of three or more goals. The previous two were 5-1 at Barcelona in April 2000 and 3-0 at Juventus in November 2012.</li>
<li>Stephan El Shaarawy&#8217;s opening goal was the first time that Chelsea have conceded in the opening minute since 1 December 2013 when Jay Rodriguez netted after 13 seconds for Southampton.</li>
<li>This goal was also the quickest that Chelsea have ever conceded in the Champions League and the quickest scored in the 2017-18 competition so far.</li>
<li>Cesc Fabregas made his 100th Champions League appearance in this match, becoming the fifth youngest to reach this landmark (30 years, 180 days).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Sion president Christian Constantin has been given a 14-month ban for striking former Switzerland coach Rolf Fringer.</p>
<p>The incident happened after Sion&#8217;s 2-1 Swiss Super League win in Lugano on 21 September.</p>
<p>Constantin, who was also fined 100,000 Swiss francs (£77,804), was filmed slapping Fringer, who is now a television pundit.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old is prohibited from entering all football-related venues. He can appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>Fringer said he had been hit several times before the blow caught on tape.</p>
<p>The Swiss Football League said: &#8220;The violent behaviour of Christian Constantin against Rolf Fringer, which (Constantin) doesn&#8217;t deny, is clearly a violation of the rules of conduct.&#8221;</p>
