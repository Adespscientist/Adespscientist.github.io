Woodhouse\u00a0became British super-lightweight champion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff also launched a boxing career after retiring,\u00a0winning his only pro bout\u00a0in December 2012 against American Richard Dawson at Manchester Arena on points.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was Betfair who approached Ferdinand about making the switch, and the betting company will help him qualify for his British Boxing Board of Control licence before he begins training and competing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The company previously backed\u00a0Victoria Pendleton\u00a0in her transition from Olympic cyclist to Cheltenham jockey.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;When Betfair approached me about the challenge, the chance to prove myself in a new sport was a real draw,&#8221; Ferdinand added.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sp-story-body__cross-head\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8216;It&#8217;s laughable&#8230; he could get himself badly hurt&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ferdinand will be coached by Team GB coach and former WBC super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;In all honesty, I think Rio can definitely box as a professional given time. He has natural power in his right hand, is extremely fit and is very enthusiastic to learn which is encouraging,&#8221; Woodhall said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Style wise, he&#8217;s very raw and I&#8217;ll have to develop this, which will take time, but he has all the natural ingredients, height and reach advantages over boxers in his weight division and definitely has potential to win a title in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The former centre-back started his career with West Ham and also played for Leeds and QPR, making more than 500 career club appearances. He was capped 81 times for England.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Woodhouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; to hear of Ferdinand&#8217;s career change.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;When it came up on my Twitter feed that Rio Ferdinand was going to become a professional boxer I thought I&#8217;d been hacked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you read every day is it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been retired three years myself and one thing I missed &#8211; and he&#8217;s probably going through himself at the minute &#8211; is the competitiveness of being an athlete.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Once that&#8217;s taken away from you it&#8217;s very, very difficult to replace it, so that&#8217;s probably what he&#8217;s chasing &#8211; to get that competitiveness back in his life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Promoter Barry Hearn said he thought there was only a 50\/50 chance that Ferdinand would receive a boxing licence, and told BBC Radio 5 live: &#8220;It&#8217;s laughable. I like Rio, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but this is an advert for a reality TV show.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;If Tony Bellew, David Haye or Anthony Joshua hit Rio Ferdinand it would probably be prosecutable by the police for using a deadly weapon. He could get himself badly hurt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s OK if it&#8217;s just a bit of fun, making a TV show and making some money. I wish him luck, I hope he enjoys it but be very careful because it&#8217;s dangerous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;He could get badly hurt and no promoter is going to sanction that. He&#8217;s being totally naive and underestimating boxing.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rio Ferdinand is launching a new career as a professional boxer, two years after he retired from football.
