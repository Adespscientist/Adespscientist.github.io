IPL matches have become a worldwide\ncricket rage. Unravel the statistics of how much the Indian Premier League\nactually makes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultra-popular IPL\nmatches in India have become another religion to unite the cricket-loving\nmasses. Gaining this massive love from the crowd, one must wonder, with the big\nbrand names and investors involved, how much money does the Indian Premier\nLeague make, after all?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all are aware of the concept of bidding and \u2018buying\u2019 players for a team. That is the root of all the rage going on for the massive sums of money that star players are sold for! Ever wondered how these IPL franchises can afford these stellar players at a whooping cost and yet make money?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> PS: Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/english-premier-league-predictions\/\">English Premier League Predictions<\/a> now <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The basic idea<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brilliance of the\nIPL structure lies in the business perspective that it has been laid out from.\nIt is much more than a sport &#8211; A cricket tournament that has amassed a great\ncommercial value. For brands, it is not only a platform to advertise their\nidentity but also a key platform for investors to make money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea here is\nto integrate private brands that will own these teams and invest in the making\nf the tournament. This is the main source of money. Now, the beauty is in the\nbalance created between the brand and corporate amalgamation with the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would brands\ninvest? &#8211; To advertise their identity in the best ways possible ways. There is\nno other league that allows players to wear brand logos on their t-shirts which\nis something the best brands would pay for! There are many high profile\nBollywood celebrities involved, which make it an even more promising platform\nfor solid entertainment that people are likely to watch at all costs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How teams make money:<br>\n<br>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the primary\nsources of money-making for these franchises include:<br>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Sponsorship \u2013 A massive chunk of the revenue\nis generated through brand sponsorships. This is to offer a platform for\npromoting the identity of the brand either through the players or\nadvertisements and visual displays on TV and the playing field.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nWith these brand names printed on shirts and jerseys, the highest revenue\nproviding sponsors are easily attained to back up the teams. Up to thirty percent\nof the main revenue is generated through sponsorship.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tickets and Merchandise \u2013 This is the part of\nrevenue generation from the masses. The selling of the tickets generates some\nrevenue, most of which is directed back to the team after the sponsors and BCCI\ndeduct a portion. <br>\n<br>\nThis is around ten percent of the total revenue that IPL teams generate. Other\nthan this, even team merchandise like t-shirts, caps, watches, bands and other\nfandom objects sell well in the environment where loyal supporters want to go\nall out! Stall renting and trading of players are other means of amassing some\nrevenue.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Media \u2013 This is where the main money-making\nlies. The BCCI gets a massive sum of money from all the broadcasters and online\nplatforms that stream the IPL matches.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThis eventually goes to the team after the due deduction. The broadcasting\nchannels make their own profits with eyes glued to their channels or the online\nforums during these ever-so-popular matches, thus, generating the main source\nof revenue for the IPL teams.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe money generated through these media rights makes up the primary source of\nincome for the IPL teams and the BCCI during the Indian Premier League. With up\nto seventy percent of the revenue generated through media right revenue, the\nIPL is able to make a great deal of money each year.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final Words<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these financial\naspects, a great deal of money is actually made through IPL. Taking about some\nof the sponsors in the past, we can observe a constant growth in the\nsponsorship fee from 2008, where DLF was the sponsor, the cost stood to be up\nto Rs. 40 Crore.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;In 2013, under\nthe sponsorship of Pepsi, the amount grew to be Rs. 72 Crore. Eventually, with\nVivo as the latest sponsor form 2016-2022, the amount grew from Rs. 100 Crore\nto a staggering Rs. 440 Crore!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On an average IPL makes 4.33 million US dollars each year owing to the masses and love that the game receives from all over the world. It is the power of the diversity of players and the unity of the sport that makes it as loved and celebrated as IPL stands to be today!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>SPONSORED POST<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/unveiling-nigerias-best-football-prediction-site\">Unveiling Nigeria&#8217;s #1 Football Prediction Site<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>META DESCRIPTION: How much money really goes into the IPL pool?
