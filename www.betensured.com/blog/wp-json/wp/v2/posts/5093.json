New betting sites are popping up left and right every day, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard for casual and master punters to spot a good bookie. As technology evolves, so do bookies, and it can be hard to keep track of all the new features and elements at new online betting sites. But that\u2019s why you\u2019re probably here reading this. Our guide will show you how to find the best football betting sites and place your bets with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting shops are a thing of the past. In 2021, online bookies rule the industry. However, choosing one has never been harder. The good news for you is that here in this article, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bettingsites.info\/football\/\">bettingsites.info recommends<\/a> a bunch of bookies that deserve your attention. We have it all \u2013 from the bookies with the highest free bets to the best odds in the business. Of course, all the sites are fully legit, so you don\u2019t have to worry about any legal consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Factors That Make or Break a Football Betting Site<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no single factor that constitutes how a good football betting site in 2021 should look like. You have to check the license, you have to check the markets, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/predictions\">match predictions<\/a>, odds, special features, and the such. In this guide, we\u2019ll show you the most important elements to look for so you can join a trusted and great betting site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be able to collect your winnings from an online bookie, you\u2019ll first need to find a reliable site. We\u2019re sad to say that not all bookies on the market in 2021 are created equal or are legal. There are plenty of rogue sites out there since its hard for the authorities to keep track and fish them all out of the pond. The good news is that a simple license check at the bottom of the page will help you identify a good bookie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be looking for a betting site with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\/home.aspx\">UKGC<\/a> or MGA license. Other proper licenses include the Gibraltar Commission or Alderney Gambling Control Commission. A bookie with either of these licenses can be called safe. Many of them will have the license number stamped in the footer too, so you can check it at the respective governing body\u2019s website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookmakers in 2021 should provide a safe and secure betting environment for their punters. In most cases, betting sites use SSL encryption that will keep your private data and transactions safe and sound. It\u2019s an absolute must for a bookie in today\u2019s market, so don\u2019t join a site that doesn\u2019t have it. You can check for the SSL encryption by clicking on the padlock icon in your browser\u2019s address bar (usually on the left side). If it\u2019s green, the site is SSL protected and safe to join. If it isn\u2019t, your browser will warn you about the unsafe connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as safety and security is concerned, a bookie with a proper license and SSL encryption should be perfectly safe. Now comes the more important part for punters \u2013 markets and odds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Markets, Odds, and Customer Support<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the legal side of things, a good betting site should have dozens of sports, thousands of markets, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/prediction-result-checker\">special features<\/a> and great odds in two. Online betting sites have taken things up a notch when it comes to the selection of markets. You can bet on more things now than ever before. We\u2019re not just talking outrights, match winners, and handicaps. Online betting sites in 2021 offer markets beyond your imagination that can drastically improve your chances of winning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more markets a bookie has, the better for you. This goes for both pre-match and live markets. Live betting is a hit right now, so don\u2019t even consider a bookie without it. It would be nice if it has live streaming too, but not a dealbreaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the odds, it\u2019s very important to shop for odds first, meaning browsing online bookies to find the best deals. After all, why should you stick to a bookie that pays less in returns for your money? Choose the one with the best odds and you\u2019ll always have the best deal on hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it makes sense to also check out a bookie\u2019s promotions. Many will offer free bets on sign up, but you should get more promos later too. Make sure the wagering requirements are fair on those bonuses too. If they\u2019re impossible to complete, it doesn\u2019t matter how great the bonus is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last, but not least, the customer support is of great importance when choosing a bookie. You\u2019ll want one that will offer several channels (email, live chat) and has fast response times. Alternatively, a good bookie will also have at least a FAQ page or a Help Center with common questions regarding online betting answered.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today\u2019s online betting market is pretty saturated.
