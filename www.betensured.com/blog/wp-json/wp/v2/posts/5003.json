While the punters are spoiled with lots of options, they are also equally confused as to which platform to choose. Moreover, with immense growing competition, casinos come up with ideas to attract players to their platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such idea is to offer punters with some lucrative bonuses and promotional deals. This not only helps players to decide which casino to play on but also potentially increases traffic at the right casino.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\u2019s learn more on bonuses and why the online casinos offer them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/casinobee.com\/bonuses\/\"><strong>Casino Bonuses explained by Casino Bee<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different kinds of casino bonuses offered and why they are offered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonuses are the means to attract players to the casino platform and maintain the customer base. Currently, online casinos offer various bonuses in different measures. But not all of them offer the same bonuses. Some of the prominent ones include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Deposit Bonus<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This bonus is offered immediately after you sign up at the casino. As the name suggests, players are not required to make any deposit to claim this deal. You are either given some amount to try the casino out or some free spin to try any slot games or both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of the no deposit bonus is to offer punters a chance to try the casino out at the expense of the casino itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deposit Bonuses\/Welcome Offers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome bonuses are leveraged on the deposits that you make after you sign up at any platform. Most of the online casinos extend bonuses on the first deposit you make. Some others offer deals on up to first three to five bonus deals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, these deals are the deposit match-up bonuses. This means, the casino matches and offers you some percentage (100%, 80%, 200% etc.) of the deposit that you make on their platform. This amount is usually given in the form of casino credits for you to use up at their online casino itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the casinos also maintain a cap to the maximum limit of their offer. The instances of deposit bonuses are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>100% First deposit match bonus up to \u20ac250.<\/li><li>80% Second deposit match bonus up to \u20ac100 + 25 free spins.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Deposit bonuses are a way to increase players\u2019 enthusiasm to gamble at that particular casino.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weekend Bonuses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us are free during the weekends and want to enjoy our time one way or other. The casinos take advantage of this and offer exclusive weekend bonuses to motivate players to gamble online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refer a Friend Bonus<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some casinos also have a provision through which you can refer your friend to their platform and earn some bonus. Now the catch here is that your friend must also sign up, deposit and play at the casino, for you to earn the bonus. Also, your referred friend might also win some exclusive deals for accepting the invitation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the online platforms offer casino bonuses for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>to encourage you to gamble on their platform<\/li><li>increase player traffic<\/li><li>to earn profits<\/li><li>to expand its customer base<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online gambling is a growing business with several casinos emerging every now and then.
