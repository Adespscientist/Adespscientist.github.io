It was seen as a downwards move for the manager as it was clear that Spurs did not have the bags of cash that Mourinho normally likes to spend on players, and the club was not seen as being title contenders anytime soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many onlookers were convinced that it was an odd pairing and that the two were not compatible, and that ultimately proved to be the case as Mourinho was fired from Spurs in April 2021, after just seventeen months in charge at the club. It was seen as a particularly callous move by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, as it was completed just a week before Spurs were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/the-carabao-cup-final\/\">due to play in the Carabao Cup final.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a quick look at some of the clubs Mourinho could potentially next call home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Valencia<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Mourinho was talking about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pokerstars.com\/en\/news\/too-much-of-a-good-thing-is-fixture-congestion-having-a-negative-effect-on-elite-footballers\/68180\/\">problem of fixture congestion for his Spurs team<\/a> earlier in the season, now that he finds himself unemployed there\u2019s no doubt he will be itching to get back into the managerial hotseat and have a busy schedule once more. One club that are apparently incredibly keen to hand over the keys to their empire are Valencia in La Liga, who\u2019ve been reported to already have initiated contact with the Portuguese superstar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valencia F.C. are a true sleeping giant of a team, with the club being the fourth-highest supported team in La Liga after the heavyweights Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atletico Madrid. They also have a new stadium that is due to be completed soon and an ambitious and rich owner, the Singaporean business magnate Peter Lim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valencia supporters have not been too impressed with Lim\u2019s ownership though, and the club have been forced to sell off key players to try to balance the books. Plus, the current manager Javi Gracia has the club languishing in the lower end of the table. No wonder then that Lim has reached out to Mourinho to come in and try to save the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Celtic<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This would have been absolutely unthinkable a few years ago, but could Celtic and Mourinho now be the perfect match? The Scottish football titans now find themselves in the shadow of Steven Gerrard\u2019s Rangers, after the blue side of Glasgow stormed to the title this season under the management of the Liverpool legend. Mourinho too will be licking his wounds, after his calamitous shift at Tottenham, where it was the first time he had ever taken charge at a club and not ended his reign with any silverware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, they could be exactly what the other needs, with Celtic desperate for someone to come in and put them back at the top of the league where they feel they belong, and Mourinho himself desperate to get some much-needed trophies to show everyone he is still a winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Roma<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1531572753322-ad063cecc140?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1355&amp;q=80%3C%3C%3C\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Will Rome be Jose\u2019s new home?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mourinho has great memories of Italy, as last time he was there he made history by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2020\/apr\/20\/mourinho-tears-and-defiance-the-story-of-inters-2009-10-season\">winning the treble with Inter Milan.<\/a> Could it be time then for him to return to Serie A and once again take a club with bags of potential to the European summit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One team that would welcome Mourinho with open arms would be Roma. The team from the Italian capital are having a disjointed season and find themselves well off the pace at the top of the table after defeats to Torino, Cagliari, and Parma. It\u2019s being said that the only way that current manager Paula Fonseca will be able to save his job is to win the Europa League. That\u2019s not going to be an easy task though, with them facing a strong Manchester United side in the semi-finals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Roma has everything that would get Mourinho interested though, with the club being home to a squad of exceptionally talented but underperforming players, and a monstrously loyal and fanatic set of supporters that make a deafening noise at the Stadio Olimpico<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s that time in world football again, one that fills pundits and supporters with excitement, as they all delve into the question of which team will recently sacked Jose Mourinho rock up to next?
