He has been able to create a strong team spirit and is currently one of the best managers in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>I had the privilege of playing alongside Zinedine Zidane in Italy for two years. He was a fantastic player with amazing technical skills and a strong personality. I was his room mate in hotels before games so I had an opportunity to know him very well.<\/p>\n<p>I expected him to be a great manager because he has all the skills to do the job. I did not expect him to achieve great results so soon though.

To win the title with him would be quite something for me before he retires.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am not a person who thinks about himself. If everything around me is fine, then I am fine too.

He told me &#8216;I will make you win the Champions League&#8217; and he has been a revelation for me. Real Madrid are used to winning finals, we have lost quite a number of them. It is a good match and we will try to overturn our record.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The emotions I might feel may be different to a younger player. Dani has won this competition and has four or five years left in his career but I have to exclude this possibility.
