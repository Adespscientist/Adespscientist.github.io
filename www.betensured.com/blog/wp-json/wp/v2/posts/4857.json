Now, said striker is no longer in the plans of the\nteam that did the \u2018emergency buying\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also not every time that you see a team sell a young\nexciting midfielder for an older one who is getting to the climax of his career\n(the jury is still out on this one).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the positive side, it is not every time that you see a\nplayer score more than 20 goals and assist more than 20 goals in the same season.\nWe have always accepted than the little magician was in a League of his own but\nthis is another amazing feat to add to his catalogue of\u2026.amazing feats!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line is, Barcelona is most going through a phase. This\ntime, things are looking very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they win the Champions League, which is highly\nunlikely, they would be without a trophy this season, something that has not\nhappened in a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether they do or not, a lot of things would have to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue seems to be that there is no long-term strategy in\nplace for this team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their main stalwarts are getting to the end of their\ncareers: Gerard Pique is 33, Jordi Alba is 31, Sergio Busquets is 32, Ivan\nRakitic is 32, Arturo Vidal is 33, Luis Suarez is 33, Antoine Griezmann is 29\nand Lionel Messi is also 33. That amounts to six players \u2013 sans Rakitic \u2013 who\nare in the Barcelona first team. This is even made worse considering the fact\nthat Arthur, 23, has been allowed to leave and Miralem Pjanic, 29, would then come\nin. There are still a number of good young players in the team but there is\nstill a lot left to be desired when it comes to performances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare this to their main counterparts in Real Madrid:\nVarane is 27, Ramos is 34, Militao is 22, F. Mendy is 25, Carvajal is 28,\nCasemiro is 28, Valverde is 22,Isco is 28, Hazard is 29, Kroos is 30, Modric is\n34, Vinicius is 20, Asensio is 24, Rodrygo is 19, Benzema is 32. There seems to\nbe a better balance for the Madrid team in terms of age and experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the issue of signings. It has been a while\nthat Barcelona has got any of its big name signings right, especially in the\nfinal third. There currently is no player in the horizon to take over from Luis\nSuarez, let alone Lionel Messi. Coutinho and Dembele have been big name\nsignings that have not been able to repay even close to the fee that Barcelona\nshelled out for them on the pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key piece would be the coach in Quique Setien.\nLetting Ernesto Valverde leave when the club was not necessarily in a crisis now\nseems like a strange decision in hindsight. &nbsp;Now, the consensus is that he managed only\nhalf a season and would be better assessed at the end of the next season. That is\na fair assessment. However, when you consider that Zinedine Zidane and Real\nMadrid, given their relationship and record, would most likely get better, then\nSetien and Barcelona would have to step up significantly. In the Champions\nLeague, a final place was all but secured before the debacle in Anfield\nhappened. Barcelona has generally not done very well in the Champions League\nsince Neymar left. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would Setien be able to set Barcelona up in a varied, more\nefficient way?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would find out soon enough, as him and his team are still\nin the Champions League.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is not every time that you get to see Barcelona not win the League.
