Under federal law, gambling is legal, which is why there are\ncasinos across the country. However, there are restrictions on online gambling,\nwith each state being free to come up with its own rules and regulations around\nthe practice. This has led to a wide disparity in terms of legality across\ndifferent states in the country. At the same time, while sports betting was\neffectively banned across the country from 1992 onwards, a recent Supreme Court\nruling in 2018 declared that law unconstitutional and thus paved the way for\nstates to allow sports betting as well. Thus, at present, different states have\ndifferent laws for different types of gambling, and it can get confusing for\nfans if they want to know if they are in danger of breaking any laws, depending\non where they are in the country. This is why there are several sites with a\ndetailed state-wise breakdown of the country\u2019s gambling laws, you can view all\nthe legal states on the <a href=\"https:\/\/gamble-usa.com\/\">latest list<\/a> on\nthe Gamble USA website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, only ten of the 56 states and\nterritories has legalized online betting, with the numbers being slightly\nbetter for sports betting, with 19 states having made it legal for sports\nbetting to take place in their territory. There are a number of states trying\nto work on legislation towards legalizing online gambling and sports betting,\nand we will list these states where there is the potential for online gambling\nto be made legal in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michigan<\/strong> &#8211; Michigan saw online sports betting being legalized in December 2019,\nalong with online poker and online casinos, and so fans in the state can now\nlegally play on websites. This law does not apply to multi-state operators,\nhowever, and so it is restricted to gambling operators from within the state\nitself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Virginia\n&#8211; <\/strong>While there are no plans at the moment to legalize\nonline casinos, the state did allow online sports betting, in a bill passed in\nApril 2020, making it legal for fans to place bets on sporting events effective\nfrom July 1st, in the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Illinois\n&#8211; <\/strong>It is a similar story in Illinois, where online\nsports betting was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.igb.illinois.gov\/SportsLaw.aspx\">legalized\nin June 2019<\/a>, with websites set to launch this year, but there being no\nplans for the same being extended to online casinos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tennessee\n&#8211; <\/strong>Online sports betting was made legal in the state in\nApril 2019, with sites launching this year. Again, there are no provisions on\nthe horizon for online casinos or card game websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the more recent developments\nin the USA, with these states being the latest ones to legalize some from of\nonline betting. Crucially though, it seems as if there is lesser opposition\ntowards online sports betting than towards online gambling, and it is entirely\npossible that online sports betting will be legal across the country in a\ncouple of years. It is a more difficult path for online casinos though, and the\nlist of states legalizing the practice will increase at a much slower rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4791\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/online-gaming-laws-in-the-usa\/adw-betensured-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?fit=1920%2C1258&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1258\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ADW-betensured-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?fit=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?fit=640%2C419&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1258\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?fit=640%2C419&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C671&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1006&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=696%2C456&amp;ssl=1 696w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=741%2C486&amp;ssl=1 741w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=1068%2C700&amp;ssl=1 1068w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?resize=641%2C420&amp;ssl=1 641w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.betensured.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ADW-betensured-1.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While it may seem as if online gambling and sports betting, being hugely popular activities in the US, are legal across the country, in reality, these pastimes are heavily regulated and illegal in many states in the USA.
