However, as it stands, the Champions League is still ongoing as the first rounds of knockouts are yet to still be completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the pandemic practically changed the world\nand European football is not an exception. On the bright side, the games must go\non and we are so here for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The likes of Atalanta, RB Leipzig, Atletico Madrid and Paris\nSt. Germain have already made it to the last eight while there are still second\nleg games as Manchester City &#8211; Real Madrid (2-1 aggregate); Barcelona &#8211; Atalanta\n(1-1); Juventus &#8211; Olympique Lyonnais (0-1) and Bayern Munich \u2013 Chelsea (3-0)\nare still yet to be played.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So who will win the Champions League 1.5 2019\/2020?&nbsp; \u201c1.5\u201d because this is not an entire revamp of\nthe competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we know now, all the games after the second legs of the\nremaining last-16 games \u2013 not like it matters as there will be no fans &#8211; will\nbe played in Lisbon. This is due to the fact that UEFA considered it a \u201csafe destination\u201d.\nAlso, the initially hosts, Istanbul, would hold the finals next year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The slim margins for error in Europe\u2019s top competition (see\nLiverpool \u2013 Barcelona 2018\/2019) has even become slimmer as the rest of the games\nwould be played in one knockout leg, as opposed to the traditional home and away\nknockout games and this may result in teams being a lot more cautious as there\nare no second-leg games to turn to. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As neutrals, we hope we are proven wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would it be free-scoring Atalanta? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would it be RB Leipzig? Their chances have been made slimmer\nas their record goal-scorer, Timo Werner, has left to join Chelsea and cannot play\nfor them in these crunch games as he is no longer under their employ.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to The Telegraph, Manchester City and Bayern\nMunich are 3\/1 favourites, although the absence of Sergio Aguero for Manchester\nCity would be a huge blow for them, and this is also assuming that they are successful\nin their second leg games (never say ever no?), Paris St Germain is priced at\n5\/1, Atalanta at 17\/2, Barcelona 8\/1, Atletico Madrid 9\/1, RB Leipzig 14\/1,\nJuventus 18\/1, Real Madrid 25\/1, Napoli 75\/1, Lyon 100\/1 and Chelsea 250\/1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more home advantage. No more crowds to spur teams on.\nJust one team against another. One thing is certain: Every team knows now that\none mistake could cost you the chance of progress as there is no second leg for\na possible redemption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is all to play for now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we all know, in an ideal world, everyone would have been looking forward to new seasons in Europe about two weeks from now.
