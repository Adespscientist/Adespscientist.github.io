<p>What comes to mind when you hear lay betting? </p>



<p>You have probably been betting for a while and never come across the term because it is not known by a good number of bettors. </p>



<p>Betting has been around for a while now and the goal for both bookies and bettors is to make money. </p>



<p>Nobody goes into a venture without thinking about profit, and it is the same for betting. </p>



<p>Gamblers are always looking for ways to beat the bookies and this has led them to an alternative market where they are pitched against one another, without the bookie manipulating the odds. </p>



<p>Compared to normal betting options, some betting companies offer punters a market (Betting exchange) where they can bet against each other and the bookies will be the referee (for a fee, of course). </p>



<p>Lay betting has been around for a while, but it is been underrated by punters.</p>



<p>This article will give you a step by step guide on how lay betting works. It is a very detailed explanation for serious bettors who wish to make money with a type of <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/matched-betting-a-beginners-guide/">matched betting</a>. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>What Is Lay Betting?</strong></h2>



<p>Lay betting can simply be said to be an option where a gambler stakes on an event not to come to pass. </p>



<p>This option allows you to take the position of a bookie, where you play the opposite of an event. A good example is if you think Manchester City with its array of lethal attacks cannot win the English Premiership league, even when you are not sure who will win it. </p>



<p>What you do then, is to simply bet that Manchester City will not win. As long as Manchester City doesn&#8217;t win the league after 38 league games, you win the stake. </p>



<p>Lay betting is an aspect of matched betting or arb betting that is gradually dominating the betting scene. </p>



<p>Lay betting is the opposite of back betting. While lay bettors bet on an event not to happen, a back bettor bets on the opposite; they bet that an event a lay bettor bets on will happen. </p>



<p>This type of betting happens on the Exchange market, and it is not common among bookmakers. </p>



<p>You will need to find a back bettor to be able to stake your bet. Both the lay bettor and back bettor will have to agree on the odds before this bet can be finalized. </p>



<p>Bookmakers provide a platform for the trade and in turn, get a commission.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Is Lay Betting Profitable?</strong></h2>



<p>Lay betting is a profitable endeavor if you are prudent and patient. The best avenue to make a profit in lay betting is by combining lay bets and back bets. Also, note that there are several free bet offers and refunds made possible at the exchange market due to lay betting. </p>



<p>To get profits from lay betting, you will need to join and know how to use a profit accumulator. This profit accumulator helps you source for all daily offers meant for bettors. It will also show you steps (which include slide and video presentations) on how to make a profit from daily lay betting. </p>



<p>Aside from profit accumulation, you will need to take these steps to make money from lay betting:</p>



<p>1. <strong>Get a good bookie</strong>: Not all <a href="https://www.bettingsites24.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="top bookmakers (opens in a new tab)">top bookmakers</a> offer the option of lay betting. You will need to check the ones that offer it and the ones best suited for you. Also, some bookmakers offer very low commission for both the back bettors and lay bettors. Check online for such reasonable bookies. There are a few who also give lots of offers and free bets on exchange and matched betting. </p>



<p>2. <strong>Avoid multiple lay bets:</strong> To make enough profit on lay betting, you need to avoid staking on multiple lay bets and concentrate only on single bets. In as much as it is tempting to &#8221; spread your nets&#8221;, avoid being greedy. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Always do background checks</strong>: Carry out enough research (statistics and form) before placing a lay bet. These minor details go a long way in increasing the possibilities of your events not coming to pass. </p>



<p>4. <strong>Avoid fixed lay bets</strong>: Be careful with people touting to have fixed games both online and offline, 99% of supposed fixed games are frauds. These fraudsters have swindled lots of amateurs in lay betting with their claims. So stick to what you know. </p>



<p>5. <strong>Start small</strong>: As a newbie in lay betting, always start with small amounts. You will learn more and be confident as you progress in lay betting. Learn while taking minimal risks first before taking larger risks when you have learned more. </p>



<p></p>



<p>PS: Check out our <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-guide/">beginner&#8217;s guide to football betting</a> here.</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Liability In Lay Betting?</strong></h2>



<p>In lay betting, liability is the amount of stake you
can lose, if everything goes south with your bet. Most punters prefer to lay a
bet at add-ons so that their liability will be mitigated. A typical example is,
when you lay a bet at 2.50 odds for 20 dollars, you are liable for 30 dollars
and could win 20 dollars if the stake comes through. </p>



<p>It will be in your interest to check how much your
liability will be and how much profit you will make eventually. Make sure your
decimal is apparent (e.g 2.50) and not 250 or else you will suffer a financial suicide.
</p>



<h2><strong>How
Do You Place A Lay Bet?</strong></h2>



<p>To place a lay bet, you need a Betting Exchange. To get
a Betting Exchange, you will need gamblers alike who are willing to back the
odds you wish to lay. This means that, if there is no available back bettor,
you can&#8217;t lay a bet. </p>



<p>This scenario implies that you need an amount of
cash available at the Exchange market to lay a bet. To put this simply; when
there is no one to bet with you, you can&#8217;t stake a lay bet alone. Also, keep
your eyes open, as odds on bet change swiftly and it could be unavailable at any
time. </p>



<p>Processes Of Placing A Lay Bet:</p>



<p>1. Find a reputable Betting Exchange </p>



<p>2. Get a bet at good odds</p>



<p>3. Find a back bettor</p>



<p>4. Agree on liability and stake</p>



<p>5. Lay a bet</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Bookmakers With Lay Bet Options </strong></h2>



<p>Several bookmakers allow this type of betting option.
However, the four most reliable ones are:</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://smarkets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Smarkets (opens in a new tab)">Smarkets</a></strong></p>

<p>D. New customers are guaranteed free 20 pounds.
(T&amp;C applies). </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>How Much Can You Win On A Lay Bet? </strong></h2>



<p>The amount of money you can win on a lay bet depends
on the rules different bookies make. That is why it is important to read the terms
and conditions attached to all transactions. Looking at lay bets which is
between two individuals, we would think that there shouldn&#8217;t be a cap on the
amount to win, but it is more technical than that. </p>



<p>While most of these betting exchanges do not have a
stipulated amount that can be won, there is however a cap on daily maximum
payouts. These maximum payouts can sometimes depend on the particular sport you
are staking on, as the case is with Betfair. </p>



<p><strong>Betfair</strong></p>



<p>Sports: Football – £1million </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse racing – £1 million </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tennis – £500,000</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Snooker – £100,000</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Darts – £250,000</p>



<p>However, with other bookmakers/ betting exchange, it
is not as strict as the above.</p>



<p><strong>Smarkets</strong></p>



<p>Minimum payout – £0.05</p>



<p>Maximum payout – £99,999</p>



<p><strong>Betdaq</strong></p>



<p>Minimum payout – £0.01</p>



<p>Maximum payout – £250,000</p>



<h2><strong>Lay
Bet Example </strong></h2>



<p>You can lay a bet on any sports of your choice as
long as it is available at the betting exchange. A vivid example of lay betting
in football and basketball will be portrayed below;</p>



<p><strong>Example
Of Lay Betting In Basketball</strong>;</p>



<p>For example, if the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami
Hits have a game and you want to lay a bet on any of the team, you can lay a
bet on, let’s say, the Los Angeles Lakers. By so doing, you are saying the
Lakers will not win the game. This means as long as the other team wins the
game, your bet is secured. </p>



<h3><strong>Example
Of A Lay Bet In Football</strong></h3>



<p>It is the beginning of La Liga Santanda. With 20
teams, you go to the exchange and look to lay bet against Barcelona not to win
the league. This is a very risky bet, but you are willing to bet with anybody
that this year league will be won by other teams and not Barcelona. </p>



<h2><strong>Why
Do People Prefer Lay Bets Over Other Options? </strong></h2>



<p>1. Some bettors find it easier to pick an event that
won&#8217;t happen over the possibility. Some gamblers just like odd games. They like
staking against the favourites. </p>



<p>2. Bettors lay bet because they think the odds are
low, even when the probability is high. Some gamblers basically deal with odds.
If they think they see a good odd for an event, they will just stake on it. </p>



<p>3. Some bettors engage in what we call trading. They
believe their funds are safe if they lay a bet on an event and go back during
the match to back such event. Lay betting affords such bettors to engage in
such trade. </p>



<p>4. Most people that engage in lay bet do so because
it seems safer than any type of gambling. </p>



<h2><strong>&nbsp;Lay Bet Calculator </strong></h2>



<p>It will be in your best interest to know how lay
bets are calculated. This will let you know your profits and liability. </p>



<p>Lay Stake: $10</p>



<p>Lay commission: 2%</p>



<p>Lay odds: 1.50</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>



<p>Liability: $5.00</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>Return: $10</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>Commission paid: $0.20</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>Profit after commission paid: $9. 80</p>



<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>



<p>If you lay a bet at $10 with the odds at 1.50, the
betting exchange collects a commission of 2% on the exchange. Your liability
will be half of your stake while return (profit) should be $10. However, the bookmaker,
where the exchange takes place, charges a commission of 2%, making your total
profit (if you win) $9.80.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>



<p>Lay bet is a kind of match betting which is done at the betting exchanges. It is not like your regular kind of betting where you bet on fixed-odds by the bookmaker. With lay bet, you (the lay bettor) and your opponent (back bettor) agree to stake on an event that may or may not come to make a profit. </p>



<p>The role of the bookmaker here is to serve as a
platform and they collect a commission on the winning. This commission
percentage depends on the bookie that you use. The amount that you can make
from lay bet depends on how much you stake with and the maximum amount your
bookie allows you to withdraw. </p>



<p>We have mentioned some bookies that allow this type
of betting exchange and the benefits they offer. If you do not know how to
calculate your liability and profit with lay bet, the sample calculator
provided above will help you in calculating with lay bet. </p>



<p>Lay bet can be safe and profitable if you follow the tips and guidelines given in this article keenly. </p>

<p>With the success of traditional sports business and the amount of financial revenue it generates, efforts have been made to find an alternative system of betting. </p>



<p>One that will be easier to play without removing any of the fun. In 1980, fantasy betting was introduced to sports-loving gamblers and the reception it got was overwhelming. </p>



<p>Fantasy betting requires very little skill but with plenty of fun. It gives the bettors total control of the team and players. </p>



<p>This article serves to show you the step-by-step guide on all you need to know about fantasy betting. You will get to know what fantasy betting is all about, how it works, the different fantasy betting sites available, and how points are assigned.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>What Is Fantasy Betting?</strong></h2>



<p>Fantasy betting is different from the traditional
methods of gambling. In fantasy betting, you create a fantasy sports team,
while competing against fellow gamblers to win cash.</p>



<p>Fantasy betting is played on many sports, including <a href="https://www.betensured.com">football</a>, <a href="https://www.betensured.com/basketball-predictions/">basketball</a>, American football, NFL, <a href="https://www.betensured.com/tennis-predictions/">tennis</a>, and hockey. The make-up of most of these fantasy sports is similar. You will have to form your own team and the player performances will either increase or decrease your points.</p>



<p>The winner of the fantasy betting is determined by
the total points accrued. These points come from played performances in actual
real-life games. </p>



<p>There is an offshoot of fantasy betting called daily
fantasy sport (DFS). Unlike the fantasy betting where you have to wait for
real-life games to get points, daily fantasy betting on sports allows you to
stake daily on the performances of players.</p>



<p>According to the FSTA, fantasy betting generated
around 7 billion dollars in total revenue in 2019.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>How Does Fantasy Betting Work?</strong></h2>



<p>You may be wondering how to go about playing fantasy betting, look no further. There are several concepts you need to grasp before you stake on fantasy betting. </p>



<p><strong>Here are the steps to follow:</strong></p>



<p>1. You need to register with a fantasy betting site.</p>



<p>2. Then you choose your preferred sport, league, and team. For example, for your preferred sport, you can pick Soccer, then you can pick the English Premier League and you can click on Arsenal for your preferred team.</p>



<p>3. Assembling your players to form a good team will
be based on your background knowledge of the sport. </p>



<p>4. Your players will earn you points based on their performances, including goals, assists, penalty saves. You lose points via yellow cards, red cards, and penalty miss.</p>



<p>5. You compete against other bettors in a contest
that can last a day, a week or month. </p>



<p>6. The team with the highest points at the end of
the contest gets the winnings.</p>



<h2><strong>How
To Make Money With Fantasy Betting </strong></h2>



<p>1. Be familiar with your chosen sports: It will be in
your best interest to stick to sports you know and follow. Choosing basketball
when you are an NFL fan is tantamount to gambling suicide.</p>



<p>2. Choose players that are on form: Do proper research on players before you pick them into your team. Choose players that you know are good and are presently on the form. Don&#8217;t be deceived by past forms and big names. You need player performances to win, therefore choose form players on form. </p>



<p>3. Know your risk: Understand what you stand to gain or lose by playing fantasy betting. You can access this information by reading the betting site&#8217;s terms and conditions. You should also take advantage of the free mode to study fantasy betting very well. </p>



<p>4. Learn from winners: Fantasy bets have professionals and it will be in your interest learn from them. It is a skill game and can be learned with proper motivation and patience. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Fantasy Betting On Mobile Platforms </strong></h2>

betting has not been left behind as it has upgraded with the latest technology.
You no longer need to rely on a computer system to play fantasy sport or check
your accrued points. Most of the top fantasy betting sites have a mobile
platform and dedicated applications which are user-friendly. You can now play
fantasy betting for cash prizes on your various Android phones and IOS devices
like iPad. </p>



<h2><strong>How

Australia, Canada and a host of other European countries. In as much as it is
legal at the federal level, some states in Canada and the US deem it illegal.
Such states include Montana, Iowa, Washington, Nevada and Arizona. In Canada,

Enforcement Act of 2006 sees fantasy sport as a skill.</p>



<h2>Common <strong>Myths About Fantasy Betting</strong></h2>



<p>There are several misconceptions bettors have about
fantasy betting; </p>



<p>1. Fantasy betting is just football: While football
betting is more popular than all betting, it is entirely false that you can play
fantasy betting on only football. There are several sports that you can play
football betting on. </p>

This is another false notion. Fantasy betting can both be fun and
money-spinning. You just have to register with the necessary fantasy betting
site to make money. </p>

<h2>5 <strong>Things To Consider Before Joining A Fantasy Betting Site </strong></h2>



<p>1. <strong>Reputation</strong>: A fantasy betting site should have a good reputation before considering doing business with them. Reputation is everything in the business. So you shouldn&#8217;t get entangled with a betting site with financial scandals; some of which may be, late payment of winnings and slow payouts. </p>



<p>2. <strong>Liquidity:</strong> You must be sure that the fantasy betting site you use has a huge financial war chest. If a betting site does not have a good liquidity ratio, they may not pay your winnings if it is too much for them. A good business should have a sustainable capital base. </p>



<p>3. <strong>The number of active customers</strong>: Fantasy betting needs lots of active players to thrive. Therefore, a good fantasy betting must have huge active customers to make playing with one another easy. </p>



<p>4. <strong>Customer service</strong>: You must consider how the fantasy betting site relates to its customers and the speed at which they solve issues. Good customer care is needed to tie loose ends and resolve complaints. </p>



<p>5. <strong>A user-friendly platform</strong>: The fantasy betting site must be one that is easy to use and very navigate, even for amateurs. It shouldn&#8217;t be complicated or slow. The site must also have various options to make an informed choice. </p>



<p></p>



<h2>The Many <strong>Pros Of Fantasy Betting</strong></h2>



<p>1. It is a great avenue to make new friends and keep
in touch with old ones. Fantasy betting encourages togetherness and
socializing. You can&#8217;t be bored or lonely playing fantasy betting. </p>



<p>2. It consumes less time especially if you engage in
Daily Fantasy Sport. Unlike most traditional types of betting that can take up
to hours or days, with DFS, you see the result within hours. </p>



<p>3. Unlike traditional betting that can only be
played by players who are 18+ and not legal in all countries. Fantasy betting
is allowed for all and has very few legal restrictions. </p>



<h2>Unavoidable <strong>Cons Of Fantasy Betting</strong></h2>



<p>1. No matter how we look at it, it is still a form
of gambling which may lead to addiction. Addiction can cause mental illness and
financial loss. </p>



<p>2. It is not free. The fantasy betting site charges
a commission for their services. For instance, if you enter a contest and stake
$200, you will have to pay 10% of your stake, which means you will be parting
with $220.</p>



<p>3. The chances of winning are very slim. This is
because most fans do not put enough time in strategic planning and research. Also,
there are lots of unforeseen circumstances that can let you get point deduction.
No one plans to get sent off or loses penalty, these things just happen. </p>



<p></p>



<h2>The Best <strong>Bet Types Available On Fantasy Betting </strong></h2>



<p>Fantasy betting has various options that a bettor
can play. Below are the more popular options;</p>



<p>1. <strong>Prize pool leagues:</strong> Here, players pay a fee to contest in a league to win a fixed amount. In this option, players will be paid depending on the position they finish on the league table. </p>



<p>2. <strong>Head-to-head contest</strong>: This option allows a player to contest against another player to win a unified prize. Some fantasy bettors believe that contesting against one player increases their chances of winning the prize. </p>



<p>3. <strong>50/50 chance</strong>: Larger leagues allow this type of option. 50/50 chance gives all players that end up at the top half of the table double their stake, while players at the lower half of the table end up with nothing. </p>



<p>4. <strong>Fantasy cash games</strong>: You join a custom-made league where the better side gets a financial reward. However, the reward given is little compared to what the other options offer. But this option is slightly easier to understand and win than other options. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Differences Between Fantasy Betting And Traditional System Of Betting. </strong></h2>



<p>1. Fantasy betting can sometimes be free, especially
if you are an amateur and just testing the ropes to get more understanding.
However, with traditional betting you cannot test anything; you will need to stake
with cash. </p>



<p>2. Fantasy sports betting is not gambling, it is a skill and a game. However, with the traditional betting, it is all about luck, it is 99%, chance, and 1% research. </p>



<p>3. With traditional betting, there are a plethora of market options that are unavailable in a fantasy sport. In Betfair, for example, there are around 98 soccer options while there are just around four to five options in fantasy betting. </p>



<p>4. The absence of commission in traditional betting
makes it cost-friendlier than fantasy bet. In traditional betting, your stake
is multiplied by odds to give you your total prize money. But a commission is
deducted by the fantasy betting site if you wish to win any prize money. </p>



<p>Conclusion </p>



<p>Fantasy betting is an option of betting, where you
are given the power to assemble your team and earn points on your players&#8217;
performance. You can play fantasy betting against one player or several players
at once. </p>



<p>Fantasy betting sites charge a minimum commission of
5% on all your fantasy bets. Although this commission varies on sports and with
several fantasy sites. Your total prize money depends on your starting
investment. </p>



<p>This article has been able to show you how fantasy betting works, several betting sites that you can play the sport on, and the differences between fantasy betting and the traditional mode of betting. The contentious issue of fantasy betting legality has also be trashed, while most countries agree it is some sort of skill, it is illegal in some states in the US and Canada. </p>



<p>Fantasy betting is fun, skillful, and can make you a profit with appropriate training and research. </p>

<p>Whether a
seasoned player or a novice, knowing the game and how to play it is a must.
After all, a huge amount of money is at stake. Many players would win in the
various online casino games, however, sometimes, they seem to lose at the very
end.</p>



<p>The primary
factor to be considered when playing online casino is to choose the right
online casino site.&nbsp; A number of online
casino sites is readily available but be wary of which site to play as some may
pose risk not only financially but to the players’ identity as well. </p>



<p>After knowing
the basics and some winning streak, it is not surprising to know how players
engage more in online casinos. So, here are some valuable tips on how to
increase the chances of winning:</p>



<ol><li>Do some research before playing
to an online casino site. The factors to be noted are the percentage of their
pay out and how fast they are able to pay. Online casino sites such as <a href="https://www.thecasinodb.com/best-online-casinos"><strong>TheCasinoDB&#8217;s Best
Sites</strong></a> have good reviews and this is a
good indication that it is reputable and trustworthy.</li><li>Look for games that offer low
house edge per bet. Low house edge refers to the measure of how much the pay
will be in comparison to what true odd would remunerate.</li><li>Refrain from chasing the
losses. It is not surprising that during the start of the game, a player may
have a losing streak, but this is quite normal when playing either in a
traditional casino or online casino. Keep the cool and don’t lose everything in
the attempt to gain everything back.</li><li>Don’t forget to collect the
bonuses such as sign-up bonus, referral bonus, loyalty bonus etc. These are
incentives that any player should get because they choose to gamble at their
casino site instead of the many other sites available in the web.</li><li>Be smart when playing. Learn
the basics as well as the tried and tested strategies. This gives players the
upper hand over those who do not have so much information. However, do not rely
so much on strategies as some online casino games are random, hence, there is
really no pattern to follow.</li><li>Set limits all the time and
play within it. It is really tempting to play online casino more so if the
jackpot is sky high but it is important to know when and where to stop.</li><li>Alcohol and gambling are a
deadly duo. Online casino may not require a player to hold an actual money but
it is still real money after all. So, it is very necessary to have a clear head
as big risks are involved when gambling.</li><li>Learn to quit while winning.
While it is good to increase the pot money, the urge to win more is a disaster
in the making. </li></ol>



<p>Winning in online casinos requires not only luck but also strategies. Knowing how to play these games will surely make the winning possibilities huge. So, while at it, know the rules of the game and never go home empty handed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Various players view domino games from different
viewpoints. Some hold the thought that domino is a game merely based on sheer
luck. On the other hand, more experienced players will have great aptitudes
while playing the games at professional levels. This is due to the
implementation of the tricks and tactics they learned or picked up along the
way. Even though there is some element of luck in domino games, skilled players
have a better chance of winning online as compared to an unskilled
one.&nbsp;Here is more about domino games.</p>



<p><strong>General considerations</strong></p>



<p>The first step in understanding how to play the game is
getting yourself acquainted with the different domino game types available.
Each type of domino game comes with its unique set of rules that you need to
take under consideration while playing. Therefore, before you even start to
play, it is essential to decide which type you are interested in and the rules
thereof. You can then go ahead to familiarize yourself with the different
domino tiles and set that you will be using. As a player, you need to judge the
total number of titles available in advance. This information enables you to
determine, though roughly, your opponent’s title hands. An amateur opponent
gives you an added advantage, therefore, a higher winning probability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Important Domino Strategies</strong></p>



<p>Generally, there are multiple different strategies you
can utilize to enhance your chances of winning the game. To begin with, you can
start by placing your game doubles early enough. Also, you should set more
involving tiles earlier and sufficiently concerning other game tiles. If you do
not feel like giving a pass during the game, consider creating different unit
varieties. Taking note of the opponent’s weak tiles may give you a head start
in formulating a winning strategy. You can adopt arithmetic maneuvers to help
you in minimizing the complexity of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Playing Domino Online</strong></p>



<p>Domino sites such as&nbsp;<a href="https://langitdominoqq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dominoqq</strong></a>&nbsp;offer game platforms suitable for all age groups.
They provide games both for fun and for earning extra cash through gambling.
With the right strategies, domino games can give you a consistent supply of
extra money that you can use to supplement your income. You will probably be
required to create an account so that your details are stored efficiently and
for rewarding purposes. </p>



<p>Gambling platforms usually facilitate the creation of
dummy player accounts, which you can utilize to try out your winning strategies
and gain confidence. Most domino games are relatively short, meaning you won’t
spend too much time playing a single match. It is important to note that <a href="https://medium.com/@dadivmicmen/domino-gambling-5572cc55c495"><strong>domino gambling</strong></a> is restricted to adults only since it needs to be done
responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Playing domino games gives a sheer feeling of
entertainment since the game, unlike some others, is authentic. Some people
play domino matches for fun, for some extra cash, or both. Whatever reasons you
may have for playing the game, you will most likely end up getting more
experience. To be able to do this, you can create either real or dummy accounts
in online platforms like&nbsp;dominoqq,
which enable you to get the game going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been different ways of <a href="https://www.betensured.com">betting on football</a> and various options bettors employ all to get past the bookmakers. </p>



<p>For punters, the major aim of betting is to make a profit
besides getting some form of entertainment from their beloved sports. </p>



<p>It is, therefore, expected that they have to always find a way to get past bookmarkers in order to win wagers. <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/matched-betting-a-beginners-guide/">Matched betting</a> and Spread betting, although not common among young punters, offers an avenue to get some real safe risk bets.</p>



<p><strong>What is matched
betting?</strong></p>



<p>Matched betting is actually a way of getting bets free, that
betting outlets and bookies provide you with. You can use a technique to ensure
that you make gain from these if you follow the laid down rules and don’t make
an error when attempting this bet type. It sounds tedious but once you watch online
video guides and educate yourself on this type of bet, you will enjoy it
greatly. Actually, it is a special betting option that requires calculations in
order to get very good offers.</p>



<p><strong>Pros of Matched
Betting</strong></p>



<p>1. You will make many gains</p>



<p>In matched betting, you stand to make lots of profit and
will rarely loose, unlike some other betting types. There is great profit to be
made. However you need to stick to offers that are greatly rated on Profit
Accumulator. What this basically means is that if you follow judiciously what
the profit accumulator forecast, you are sure to make great profit and in no
short time build up your bankroll from the recommended £70 – £150 that you
should start with. Lots of punters have made money from matched betting through
this way. Not that they don’t lose, however it is not up to their gains. </p>



<p>2. You don’t need a specific skill or knowledge to win big</p>



<p>Although most punters and gamblers alike categorize match
betting as a high-risk option, it usually delivers. What makes it interesting
is that you can start today and make big money today. It doesn’t take a special
skill to make big money. You know from the beginning that you may put some
money in, with a good chance of making a profit; however, it may not always pay
off. It is advisable to save around 15-25% of your previous months profit
solely for completing such offers.</p>



<p>3. There is a high chance to win huge without losing much</p>



<p>We have had testimonies of people who won over 10,000
dollars within a week of starting matched betting. This was off the back of an
offer the winner completed thanks to matched betting. Although this is quite rare.
I have also heard also know people that have matched bet for 1-2 years now and
their biggest win is around £100 – £150. Of course, this is still a great sum
of money but the chance of winning big is unlikely. Therefore all it takes is
good analysis and a bit of luck.</p>



<p>This is due to the nature of matched betting. If you
complete a matched betting offer that is rated as high-risk, which means you
lose cash, you will daily set your free spin-stakes low to minimize your loss
and increase your chance of winning big. What this implies is that your chance
of a winning big is never going to be high. This is all about luck here. No high
technique needed for a big win.</p>



<p><strong>Cons of Matched
Betting</strong></p>



<p>1. It is very difficult for an average punter to understand
it</p>



<p>&nbsp;Unlike your regular
betting options and markets, matched betting will require you to be patient and
calculative to be successful. Most punters believe matched betting is too
analytic for them and not straight forward like regular bets. Actually, it is
right to a great extent, but some find it very easy, especially those who are
very analytical. </p>



<p>2. It needs a bold personality to start it and make profit</p>



<p>This type of betting requires you to preserve and be brave
to make lots of money. The reason behind this is simple, like most betting, you
will lose before you win. If you have a timid mindset and personality, you
might give up before you make money. Therefore most people are already
discouraged before they hit the jackpot. However, for the strong-minded bettors,
they find it very easy to learn and stake wisely believing with time, they will
make huge profit. </p>



<p><strong>What is Spread
Betting?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_betting">Spread betting</a> is a very old system of betting, though not every bookmaker offers this type of betting due to its complexity. This concept is based on how precise (or inaccurate) the staker{s} is on a number of predictions. The bookie sets a betting spread according to what he believes is the likely event that will pan out. It is now up to the wager to decide whether he/she thinks the actual event will be greater or lower than their predicted spread. Everything about spread betting is always calculated on a higher or lower agreement, this is why spread betting works really well for some particular gambling markets. The total number of goals scored in a particular match is a very interesting market that works with spread betting.</p>



<p>To further understand Football Spread Bet, for instance, </p>



<p>Barcelona FC vs. Levante Total Goals – Sell 2.8 | Buy 3.0</p>



<p>Buy at 3.0</p>

<p>If the result is 2 goals then you would win 0.9 multiply by your

<p><strong>Pros of Spread
Betting</strong></p>



<ol><li>Multiple Number of betting opportunities: </li></ol>



<p>The total number of betting opportunities
in this type of betting is of great advantage. Spread betting occurs majorly in
most of the major sports, therefore, there are many markets which do not
accommodate the normal traditional betting but which you apply to spread
betting. Also, more betting opportunities will bring more chances of finding
valuable stakes to place, so it is of great merit to the betting.</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;Trading
or closing out positions: </li></ul>



<p>What this simply means is that arranging a
stake before an event comes to a conclusion. This happens because spreads are usually
during live matches, and there is usually an option to settle one’s stakes at
any time based on the last spread. Therefore, if things are looks bright for you
and your proposed wagers are sailing smoothly, it is very possible and highly
likely to take out some profit. If things are looking bad, you can cut your
losses before they have an adverse effect. This comes in handy and can to help bettors
manage risk.</p>



<ul><li>There is no visible Limit to winnings: </li></ul>



<p>That there is no limit to the times you can
win is a huge bonus to those interested in spread betting. Most bookies are swift
in limiting winners and limit the amount they can bet. In certain extreme, betting
accounts are close completely. This clearly makes it very tedious and
frustrating for successful gamblers to continue winning. However, spread
betting companies don’t take such drastic steps. They make their gains based on
the differences between the sell and buy prices, and are rarely affected by
consistent winners than normal bookies are.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cons of spread betting</strong></p>



<ol><li>Very few bookies and firm operate spread
betting: </li></ol>



<p>If you are interested in spread betting, it
is significant to be known that not every bookie or betting firms make spread
betting available. What this simply means is that unlike traditional options
and market that can be found on all online bookies, spread betting is only
offered by a few betting companies. You have to search deeper or ask around to
know which firms operate this option</p>



<ul><li>Bonuses and rewards are non-existent or
infinitesimal: </li></ul>



<p>Unlike traditional markets that have
mouth-watering bonuses and rewards, when it comes to spreading marketing
option, this is not available due to the risk involved. Most companies that
offer spread marketing rarely give bonuses and rewards and few that too give
out very little bonuses.</p>



<p><strong>Matched betting vs.
spread betting: Which one should you pick?</strong></p>



<p>To choose which is better between matched betting and spread
betting will be a herculean task for anybody because both types of betting
require similar skills and patience to succeed, but depending on your
personality and the resources available, you may prefer one over the other.</p>



<p>&nbsp;For punters who have
calculative skills and are good analytically, it will be advisable for them to
sway more towards matched betting because it is highly possible for them to
succeed there with their traits. </p>



<p>However, if you are the patient type and can take a huge
risk, then you can go for spread betting as it will be suitable for you. </p>



<p>Making a choice between each of them will be difficult and
inaccurate because they each have merits and demerits. Whichever you decide to
go for, but like all bets, be addicted to gambling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>UEFA Champions League is one of the oldest and most reputed football tournaments across the world and it is considered as one of the ideals ones in the world of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.casino-online-canada.ca/sportsbook/" target="_blank">sports betting</a> as well! </p>



<p>It is over six decades old and the tournament has witnessed many changes in this time frame. The present format of the tournament has 32 teams which are divided into 8 groups with 4 teams in each group named A to H. </p>



<p>By the way, do you think the <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/has-the-premier-league-season-restart-been-a-disappointment/">Premier League season restart has been a huge disappointment?</a></p>



<p>They are going to play within each other in the group at the group stage and finally, 16 teams will make it to the next round and the rest will get eliminated. The draw of the tournament is out just a few days back and everything looks well placed. </p>



<p>So let&#8217;s have a preview of the tournament and of the upcoming matches and try to find out what is in the offering in this year&#8217;s UEFA Champions League.</p>



<p>If you are interested in getting the latest football prediction tips, check out the <a href="https://www.betensured.com">#1 football prediction site in Nigeria</a></p>



<p>We are just a few days away from the most exciting and popular European Club football tournament. Champions league matches are going to commence in a couple of days from now and the draws are already out. While some of the groups have good competition, others does not seem to have that much of a competition as such. However, predictions and permutations and combinations are good till the <a href="http://www.betensured.com/blog/unveiling-nigerias-best-football-prediction-site">match starts</a> and it makes up for a good starter. The present level of most of the teams is great and they have the caliber and ability to surprise and change the results. In this article, we are going to have a quick look at the draw and the groups and we are going to analyze and predict the results of the preliminary matches of the Champions League.</p>



<p>Group A</p>



<p>Club Brugge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Galatasaray AŞ</p>



<p>Paris Saint-Germain&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Real Madrid CF</p>



<p>Group A consists of the above 4 teams. Real Madrid has won
the tournament for the maximum time and they seem to be the favorite for
topping this group as well. However, there seems to be a close competition for
the second spot. All three teams have their fair chances to make it into the
knockout stage. It would be interesting to see which among the other three
would make it in the next round.</p>



<p>Group B</p>



<p>FC Bayern München&nbsp; </p>



<p>FK Crvenazvezda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Olympiacos FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Tottenham Hotspur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group B consists of above 4 teams. Out of these four
Tottenham Hotspur seems to lead the group. However, there is no guarantee that
they are going to top the group. Other teams are equally good and they can
surprise each other and therefore it would be hard to determine which among
these four teams would make it to the next round. However, Tottenham seems to
be favorite for topping this group with other options quite wide open.</p>



<p>Group C</p>



<p>Atalanta BC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>FC Shakhtar Donetsk </p>



<p>GNK Dinamo Zagreb&nbsp; </p>



<p>Manchester City FC</p>



<p>Group C has Manchester City FC and Atlanta BC as quite
favorites for topping the group. They are comparatively well placed and stand a
very good chance of making it into the knockout stage. It seems that they are
unlikely to suffer any surprises and should make it comfortably into the last
16 stage.</p>



<p>Group D</p>



<p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen </p>



<p>Club Atlético de Madrid</p>



<p>FC Lokomotiv Moskva</p>



<p>Juventus</p>



<p>Group D consists of above 4 teams. Juventus seems to be favorite
for topping the group. Although the other two teams have good chances of
surprising each other and they can also give a good run for money to Juventus.
This is an interesting group and we have to wait till the end to determine
which two teams make it to the next round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group E</p>



<p>FC Salzburg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>KRC Genk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Liverpool FC&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>SSC Napoli</p>



<p>The defending Champions Liverpool are placed in group E.
There are some good teams in this group is well but Liverpool and FC Salzburg
seems to be stronger than the other two teams. However, there are good chances
that Nepali and krcgenk can surprise each other and make it into the next
round.</p>



<p>Group F</p>



<p>Borussia Dortmund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>FC Barcelona</p>



<p>FC Internazionale Milano</p>



<p>SK Slavia Praha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Group F seems to be most interesting as well as the strongest
and toughest group. It has Barcelona which is the most popular team of the
tournament. Apart from it, the group has got AC Milan which is a strong team
closely follows by Dortmund and Praha. All these teams have strong players and
fans support. It would be interesting to see which among these&nbsp; 4 are able
to make it to the next round As said earlier, this is the toughest group of the
tournament.</p>



<p>Group G</p>



<p>FC Zenit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Olympique Lyonnais&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>RB Leipzig&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>SL Benfica</p>



<p>Group G consists of the above 4 teams. All of these teams are
at par with each other and they have chances of making it to the next round.
They are good chances of draws as well. Therefore the goal difference can also
play a crucial role to determine the final two teams that make it to the round
of 16. This is an open group and can have any of the two out of the four, who would
make it to the next round.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Group H</p>



<p>AFC Ajax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Chelsea FC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>LOSC Lille</p>



<p>Valencia CF</p>



<p>Group H is yet another interesting group with Ajax, Chelsea
along with Valencia CF in it. All these teams are more or less at par with each
other and they could well surprise each other at any time and in any match. So
we have to wait till the end to determine which among these four teams finally
make it into the next round.</p>



<p><strong>Final
words</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Professional
horse race betting has always been a popular sport for many people, and due to
the fact of its ever gaining popularity, new people are coming into the
spectrum. However, with a massive inflow of people betting on the races and the
significant amount of money involved, horse race betting has become a highly
structured and organized event which needs a lot of time and effort for anyone
to master. <a href="https://ronwilliamsracing.com/">Horse Racing Tipsters</a> realized the problems that newcomers and seasoned veterans
face while betting and tries to give a guideline regarding what the best
possible approach is towards this sport.</p>



<p>With thousands
of races happening all across the United Kingdom over the summer, an individual
can&#8217;t follow each and every one of them, let alone have the time to analyse all
of them. The best way to approach a betting season is by segregating the market
and focusing on a set of races that you are familiar with. Following these
races closely and analysing them will be a lot easier, and will lead you to
have a well-informed opinion, leading to better odds of betting on the right
horse in the right race. Maintain a list of data regarding these races and how
each horse and rider performed in each race and under what conditions, this
information will make or break your betting season.</p>



<p>The English
summer is unpredictable, and you need to account for this when you are placing
your bets. If the weather changes, the best option is to exercise patience and
re-evaluate your choices, rather than betting pre-emptively. A bet made on the
assumption of the horses racing on firm ground, when in actuality, due to
rains, the horses are racing on soft ground, will significantly affect the
results. Similarly, also take into account the horses and riders, and what
traits define them. If a race has two horses and riders that start of really
well, they would be giving a hard time to each other, which could open up the
gates for a hold-up horse to win the race. The more races you follow, the
better your understanding of riders&#8217; preferences and horses.</p>



<p>The draw and
which horse will race at which track also is a major influencing factor when
races occur. Some racecourses have strips of track that are faster than the
others. This greatly influences the results of the race as horses who are drawn
on these favourable racing strips tend to have an advantage, which ultimately
leads them to win. Analysing racecourses is another big part of betting that
most people overlook and it is a crucial mistake which needs to be addressed.</p>



<p>Maintaining a database of all the races, and also all the bets that you have placed on races throughout the season is necessary. Analyse which bets were profitable, who was the horse, what were the conditions and what odds were offered. This data over a period of time adds to your knowledge and ultimately leads to big winnings.</p>
