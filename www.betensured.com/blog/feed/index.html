<p>Gambling is, by its very nature, a risk-ridden way to fill your time or even to try and make money. But, when done sensibly, it can also be a fun and exciting addition to watching sport.</p>



<p>But how do you make the most of your bet? What&#8217;s the best way to get around the bookies&#8217; tricks that try and pull you through their doors?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about finding the best value for money. Whether that&#8217;s the right prices, the right markets, or even the best time to put your bet on, follow these tips from an ex-betting shop employee and see if you can make the most from your gambling experience.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Know your sport inside out<br></strong>It&#8217;s not just about which football team has won their last six games but how well they have played offensively and defensively. Were they good at keeping possession, or were they lucky?</li></ol>



<p>Which tennis player is having a spat with their coach? That golfer might have won two majors this season, but how much experience does he have on a links course?</p>



<p>These are the kinds of details that will inform your betting and will better prepare you for spotting those good-value markets.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>The favorite doesn&#8217;t always win</strong><br>It might seem obvious to point out, but it is difficult for any punter to ignore the price bookies have given.</li></ol>



<p>A good example? When Rafael Nadal took on Fabio Fognini at the Barcelona Open in April, bookmakers had Nadal as the heavy favorite. He was as short as 1/10 with some.</p>



<p>On the surface, this would make sense. Nadal is the King of Clay and has won this very tournament a record-breaking eight times.</p>



<p>The bookmakers had overlooked that Fognini had beaten Nadal on clay only a few months earlier in Rio De Janeiro. Combine this with Fognini&#8217;s record of knocking out top seeds, and suddenly his 8/1 price is looking very attractive.</p>



<p>Fognini went on to beat Nadal in straight sets.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Don&#8217;t just stick to one bookmaker – shop around</strong><br>There is a big emphasis on brand loyalty in the betting business. Because it&#8217;s such a competitive sector, companies will try and lure you into betting with them and only them.</li></ol>



<p>Whether this is through various loyalty schemes or special in-shop offers, the intention is the same.</p>



<p>Your research should tell you which of these offers will most suit you for any given match. Be flexible and be prepared to put in the leg work.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>The fewer selections, the better</strong><br>This is something that, even though it seems like common sense, punters forget all the time. The fewer selections you include in your bet, the more chance you stand of winning.</li></ol>



<p>Suppose you&#8217;re betting to make money think small, not big. One team or selection if you can stake enough. Three or four maximum. Once you find yourself putting that 20-fold accumulator on, you are on cloud cuckoo land.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Avoid the temptation of odds-on prices</strong><br>If you do find yourself desperately wanting that long-shot bet on a Saturday afternoon, do not pad out your accumulator with odds-on selections. You&#8217;re decreasing your chance of winning for next to no extra cash. This is easy to do in tennis. It&#8217;s the opening week of a Grand Slam, and you see the top players are all drawn against relative unknowns. It would seem like a great idea to lump them all together in multiple to try and win some easy money. But this would be a mistake.</li></ol>



<p>Tennis is notorious for offering terrible prices on match-betting, and so you could put the world&#8217;s elite in a ten-fold and still only manage to scrape returns at 3/1.</p>



<p>Is it worth £10 to only treble your money when any single loss at a price of 1/8 (for example) would result in your total bet going down? Probably not.</p>



<p>It would make more sense to do some research and find an up-and-coming player who has a favorable draw and back them at a better price.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Consider the less obvious markets</strong><br>Again, once you&#8217;ve done enough research, you should know you&#8217;re sport well enough to find better value in the hundreds of other markets the bookies offer.</li></ol>



<p>It is arguably a way for the bookies to provide you with more ways to lose, but you can find good prices if you look hard enough.</p>



<ol start="7"><li><strong>Make sure you understand the markets</strong><br>While we&#8217;re on the subject of the less obvious markets, if you pick an obscure one, check the terms with the betting shop staff.</li></ol>



<p>A common mistake is a half-time/full-time bet vs. to win both halves. If you put HT/FT bet on, your team simply has to be winning at half-time and then win the match.</p>



<p>If you back your team to win both halves, you are betting on them to win the first half and the second half separately. The team must score more goals than the opposition in both halves for you to win your bet.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a subtle difference but frustrating for punters who come looking to collect winnings when their team was leading 2-1 at half-time and won the match 2-1. The second-half score must have been 0-0, and so the bet goes down.</p>



<ol start="8"><li><strong>Don&#8217;t bet with your heart</strong><br>You might want your team to win. You want it so badly you even start to convince yourself it&#8217;s possible. Before you know it, you believe it so much that you&#8217;ve put your money on it.</li></ol>



<p>And bookies love it because each week, they&#8217;ll rake it in from all the home fans willing their soon-to-be relegated team to beat the table leaders.</p>



<p>Similarly, avoid important events like derby games. The unpredictable element has been magnified because there&#8217;s more at stake, and players may elevate themselves for that extra degree of honor and pride.</p>



<p>If you must bet on these events, consider the other markets. They probably won&#8217;t beat the table leaders, but could they get a goal? The result and both teams to score could be a more sensible bet.</p>



<ol start="9"><li><strong>Pick your moment</strong><br>It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint the right time to place your bet because, unlike with horse racing, it&#8217;s not &#8216;best odds guaranteed&#8217; on sports bets, but it&#8217;s usually best to do it on the day.</li></ol>



<p>But most bookies will enhance prices or have special offers ahead of a popular event.</p>



<p>Some will do this for the whole day of the event itself. Others will boost a price for a set period at random points, meaning unless you spend the day in the shop, you&#8217;ll only come across these by chance.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a top-rated event, the bookies will almost certainly be promoting it with offers designed to persuade you to part with your cash.</p>



<p>It could mean money back as a free bet if the favorite scores first in a football fixture.</p>



<ol start="10"><li><strong>It pays to follow less popular sports</strong></li></ol>



<p>As bookmakers try and offer more and more ways for us to hand over our cash, they are forever expanding the list of sports and markets they cover.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, this means that they cover sports they might not know as much about as they would like.</p>



<p>A good example is MMA. The sport of mixed martial arts is on the rise, so we are getting increasingly more coverage and more information about competitors.</p>



<p>When world bantamweight champion, Ronda Rousey, stepped into the Octagon at UFC193, she was a heavy favorite, and her opponent Holly Holm was out as far as 9/1 early and still 6/1 when the fight got underway.</p>



<p>But why was Rousey at such a short price? Holm is a boxing world champion, while Rousey&#8217;s striking is somewhat lacking. Rousey&#8217;s strength was her judo, yet Holm had defended 100% of takedowns going into this fight.</p>



<p>It was never going to be as clear-cut as everyone thought, and any real look at the stats ahead of the event suggested that 6/1 was amazing value.</p>



<p>Not only did Holm go on to win the fight, but she KO&#8217;d the champ in just two rounds.</p>



<p>Everyone will have good days and bad days but follow these tips, and you should soon be able to spot the best value bets available and hopefully reap the rewards!</p>



<p>Just remember, only bet what you can afford to lose, never chase your losses and if the fun stops, stop!</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Derby Festival took place at the picturesque Epsom Downs. The two-day meeting is home to three Group 1 races, and none more prestigious than the festival’s namesake, the Derby.</p>



<p>Racing fans and connections will now be gearing up for the next big meeting – Royal Ascot – which takes place this week. While you’re looking for the latest <a href="https://www.betdaq.com/exchange/horse-racing/100004">horse racing tips</a>, let’s remind ourselves of the big winners at Epsom.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Oaks: <em>Snowfall</em></u></strong></p>



<p>The third of five British Classics, the Oaks is only open to fillies, and it was <em>Snowfall</em> who handed trainer Aidan O’Brien yet another win in the race – his ninth victory since 1998. Frankie Dettori was in the saddle, as he rode <em>Snowfall </em>to a record 16-length victory, surpassing the previous record set by <em>Sun Princess </em>in 1983 – to also notch his sixth Oaks winner.</p>



<p>The Japanese-bred filly started off towards the rear of the pack, but Dettori powered on through the rain, taking the lead with just under two furlongs to go. It was an impressive finish that saw the duo push on and go clear in the final furlong. Stablemate <em>Divinely </em>finished in third, while the favourite, <em>Santa Barbara</em>,also from O’Brien’s yard could only finish fifth.</p>



<p><strong><u>Coronation Cup: <em>Pyledriver</em></u></strong></p>



<p>There was a new winning trainer in the Coronation Cup, as William Muir &amp; Chris Grassick’s <em>Pyledriver </em>won in what proved to be a thrilling race. <em>Al Aasy </em>was the pre-race favourite, and was denied in the closing stages, having held up in rear in the early stages, before going on to lead in the final furlong. A neck separated first from second, while <em>Japan</em>, trained by O’Brien finished in third, seven lengths behind.</p>



<p>It was a first Group 1 victory for <em>Pyledriver </em>with Martin Dwyer in the saddle. The jockey has now won all three of Epsom’s centrepiece races – his previous wins include the Oaks (<em>Casual Look</em> in 2003) and the Derby (<em>Sir Percy</em> in 2006). On completing the hat-trick of Group 1s at Epsom, <a href="https://www.racingbetter.co.uk/epsom_derby/coronation_cup.html">Dwyer said</a>;</p>



<p><em>“It’s special. If you’re not fashionable it’s hard to get good rides. Sometimes you feel you are defending yourself if you don’t win. Half my worry was losing the ride on him. When it comes right and you win a big race, you enjoy it that bit more. I’m very excited. He can only get better.”</em></p>



<p><strong><u>The Derby: <em>Adayar</em></u></strong></p>



<p>There was a surprise win, as 16/1 shout <em>Adayar </em>won the Derby. Jockey, Adam Kirby had been scheduled to ride <em>John Leeper</em>, before Frankie Dettori was called up – and instead, Kirby was handed <em>Adayar</em> – replacing Oisin Murphy in the saddle.</p>



<p>But it was a move that appeared to pay off, as Kirby guided <em>Adayar </em>to victory by four and a half lengths over 50/1 chance <em>Mojo Star </em>in second, and <em>Hurricane Lane </em>in third. It’s not the first time that Kirby has defied the odds, having won at Royal Ascot last year, when riding <em>Nando Parrado </em>in the Group 2 Coventry Stakes – a rank outsider at 150/1.</p>



<p>And <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/57370912">the jockey’s reaction</a> at the finish line said it all:</p>



<p><em>“This is the Derby lads &#8211; get in there!”</em></p>

<p>Football is all about scoring goals, but over the past couple of decades the value of players who can provide assists has risen and risen. Now, a quality creative player is vital in any team, none more so than the teams hoping to win the European Championships this summer.</p>



<p>Having someone who can pick passes and lay the ball on a silver platter for their teammates is vital in a team establishing themselves as one of the favourites in the <a href="https://www.betfair.com/sport/football/uefa-euro-2020/11997260">Euros 2020 odds</a>. Here we’ve picked out five of the top assist-makers from the big domestic leagues in Europe over the last season. Read on to find out who the kings of the assists will be for their national teams this summer.</p>



<p>Thomas Müller (Germany)</p>



<p>While Robert Lewandowski may get most of the headlines for Bayern Munich, Thomas Müller continues to be one of their most important players in terms of providing for his teammates. Last season, Müller notched an astonishing 21 assists in the Bundesliga, and he’ll be hoping to carry that form into Euro 2020 after being recalled by Germany coach Joachim Löw. Müller has always been a great servant to the German national team, and it would be no surprise to see him make some major contributions this summer.</p>



<p>Steven Berghuis (Netherlands)</p>



<p>The 2020-21 campaign was a sensational one for Netherlands international Steven Berghuis. Alongside the 18 goals he bagged for Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, he also recorded 14 assists, statistics which have seen him linked with a number of clubs throughout Europe. He’ll be hoping to replicate some of that form for the Netherlands this summer, as he attempts to help the national team recover from missing out on two consecutive international tournaments.</p>



<p>Jadon Sancho (England)</p>



<p>Another player who was one of the Bundesliga’s top assist makers last season is England’s Jadon Sancho. The Borussia Dortmund winger has impressed greatly since he arrived in Germany, and England coach Gareth Southgate will be hoping that Sancho can do the business at Euro 2020 and help fire England to a first major international title since the 1966 World Cup. Sancho isn’t a guaranteed starter for the Three Lions, but Southgate will be confident that the 21-year-old can contribute assists for the team.</p>



<p>Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium)</p>



<p>What more can you say about Kevin De Bruyne? He has been one of the defining players of Manchester City’s success in recent years, and there are few better midfielders in world football at the moment. De Bruyne enjoyed another fine season in 2020-21, recording plenty of assists as usual, and he’ll be hoping to turn provider for his Belgium teammates at the Euros this summer. De Bruyne could miss the first match of the tournament after suffering facial injuries in the Champions League final, but when he is fit Belgium will be relying heavily on his contributions.</p>



<p>Kingsley Coman (France)</p>



<p>While Kingsley Coman isn’t necessarily a guaranteed starter for France at the upcoming Euros, he certainly has the ability to contribute goals and assists when he is called upon. He recorded 12 assists for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season, and with plenty of talent in the French ranks for Euro 2020, coach Didier Deschamps will want everyone chipping in France’s bid to hold both the World Cup and European Championship title at the same time.</p>

<p>The Euro 2020 group stage is over, and some of the continent&#8217;s in-form strikers have taken their club form into the tournament.</p>



<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, and Ciro Immobile were among the top scorers in Serie A, and all three have made blistering starts to the tournament.</p>



<p>Harry Kane, who was the favorite to win the Golden Boot with some bookies,<a href="https://blog.betway.com/football/euros/euro-2020-tips-best-bets-for-the-golden-boot/"> betway</a> inclusive before the tournament kicked off, wrapped up the top scorer award for the Premier League, with Bruno Fernandes finishing in third. However, both players are yet to hit the ground running after the group stages. Harry Kane has just one shot on target in 180 mins.</p>



<p>But, who will take the Golden Boot for the Euros come next month?</p>



<p>The Euro 2020 group stage is over, and some of the continent&#8217;s in-form strikers have taken their club form into the tournament.</p>



<p>The top goal scorers as it stands</p>



<p>RONALDO (PORTUGAL) 5 GOALS</p>



<p>LUKAKU 3(BELGIUM), SCHICK 3(CZECH REPUBLIC), IMMOBILE 3(ITALY),</p>



<p>FORSBERG 3(SWEDEN), WIJNALDUM 3(NETHERLANDS)</p>



<p>Ronaldo has consistently scored goals everywhere and anywhere, and it&#8217;s no surprise he is leading the way for the much-coveted No 9 award in the ongoing Euros. He has equaled the most international goals in European competitions, and he is just three goals shy of breaking Ali Daei&#8217;s record of 109 international goals. The extent to which he wants to achieve that is evident, and he looks sharper and determined to do that before the end of the Euros. Being on penalty duties has indeed helped his course scoring three penalties so far in the tournament.</p>



<p>Kane topped the scoring charts in qualifying with 12 goals from his 22 shots, boasting an impressive 55% goal conversion rate. Cristiano Ronaldo (11 goals), Teemu Pukki (10), Artem Dzyuba (nine), Raheem Sterling, Georginio Wijnaldum, and Serge Gnabry (all eight) were also among those to qualify for the finals with an impressive scoring rate.</p>



<p>Naturally, the further a team progresses in the tournament, the greater the chance their goal scorers have of clinching the Golden Boot. That puts the likes of Lukaku right among the favorites, with Belgium expected to make a deep run at a tournament, which is scheduled to conclude in London.</p>



<p>The European Championships were expanded to accommodate 24 teams in 2016, and UEFA is sticking with that format this time around. That means there will again be a knockout fixture before the quarter-finals, and the finalists will have to play seven matches in total. That is one more than in 2012 when a meager tally of three goals was enough to clinch the Golden Boot for Fernando Torres.</p>



<p>Yes, the last three Golden Boot winners made it to the final, but every side will play at least three matches in the group stages. Savo Milosevic, who shared the Golden Boot with Patrick Kluivert in 2000, only reached the quarter-finals with Yugoslavia that year, scoring four of his five goals before the knockout stages began.</p>



<p>The 2014 World cup is a testament as well, with James Rodriguez bowing out in the quarter-finals, but his six goals were enough to secure the golden boot award.</p>



<p>WHO WILL GO FURTHEST??</p>



<p>England was in uncharted territory heading into the tournament as joint-favorites to win the trophy. Gareth Southgate led the Three Lions to the World Cup semi-final three summers ago, and some of his raw youngsters from that run have since flourished with another two years of development now behind them. But, the initial excitement has just tempered slightly following two poor showings at Wembley. Harry Kane couldn&#8217;t provide a shot on target until their 3rd game, and they have scored just two goals against inferior teams with all due respect. This is football, though, and anything can happen, but I believe Harry is no more in the mix for the golden boot award.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, world champions France is perhaps being underestimated. Didier Deschamps still has bucket loads of talent at his disposal, but the fact they will not have home advantage at any point this summer could count against them.</p>



<p>The Netherlands are also fancied to put together a decent charge for silverware, with a crop of impressive stars behind their resurgence under Ronald Koeman and, more recently, Frank de Boer. The protracted wait for Euro 2020 could have worked in their favor, with an extra 12 months to continue building their momentum. And they&#8217;ve started with three wins on the bounce, ending Group C perfect.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Belgium coach Roberto Martinez arguably has the best squad depth, and their &#8216;Golden Generation&#8217; will be expected to challenge for the Euro 2020 crown after their run to the World Cup semi-final in 2018. Italy is also in impressive form under Roberto Mancini and has made a flawless start to Euro 2020.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Lukaku and Ronaldo seem overwhelmed favorites because the most predicted winner in Harry Kane is yet to register a goal yet and others like Patrick Schick, Ciro Immobile, and others who have three goals doesn&#8217;t seem to have the full capacity to challenge Belgium or France and France, on the other hand, does not have anyone close to 3 goals yet. Interestingly, both Lukaku and Ronaldo have been paired against each other in the knockout stages. Neither of the two is sure to exit the tournament as early as the Round of 16. Ronaldo&#8217;s tally of 5 could see him scoop this award even if he exits at this stage, but it does give the likes of Lukaku, Immobile, Wijnaldum, who have a much relatively good fixture, to go all the way. Ronaldo&#8217;s progress would put him in pole position as you wouldn&#8217;t bet against Ronaldo to score a couple more before exiting the tourney or retaining the trophy, maybe. The Sunday crunch fixture is going to have a tell in the race for the golden boot. However, it is to be noted that the run into the final for whoever progresses doesn&#8217;t get any easier as they are likely to face Italy, England or France, and Germany again.</p>



<p>In conclusion, my bet is on Ronaldo to clinch this ahead of Lukaku, irrespective of whatever happens in their match with Belgium. Lukaku looks good, though, especially when you have a playmaker of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard; chances will come his way, and trust him to finish them off. I don&#8217;t think he will outscore Ronaldo if even he exits early because of some stern defenses he will come against progressing to the finals</p>

<p>With <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/epl-monthly-awards-for-2020-2021-season/">the 2020/2021 EPL season</a> officially coming to a close, the top-four spots and relegation battles have been decided, and the stage is set for the 2021/2022 season. The season was quite unusual, to say the least, although it was among the most competitive seasons with nine different teams dominating the league at different times.</p>



<p>Manchester City finished as the season champions, after displaying an incredible run which got them 21 straight wins between December and March in all their competitions. West Brom, Sheffield, and Fulham ended their campaign in the relegation zone in a season where fans were missed in stadiums. Fortunately, the end of one season signals the beginning of another, and Betway punters are excited about the prospects of wagering on the upcoming 2021/2022 EPL season.</p>



<p><strong>When is the 2021/2022 EPL Season Kick-Off?</strong></p>



<p>The upcoming 2021/2022 EPL campaign will kick off on Saturday, 14<sup>th</sup> August 2021, with the opening match coming only a month after the Euro final game. That means some players will only rest for a few weeks before the beginning of the season. Fortunately, fans are set to be welcomed back in stadiums, and fixture congestion will be less frequent.</p>



<p>Next season is promising to be another exciting installment of England’s top flight, with the final matchday set to come exactly after a year. As such, Betway <a href="https://www.betway.co.zm/sport/soccer">live soccer betting</a> enthusiasts can expect to wager on games until game week 38, set to happen on Sunday 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2022.</p>



<p><strong>When Will The 2021/2022 EPL Fixtures Get Announced?</strong></p>



<p>The 2021/2022 Premier League campaign fixtures are set to be announced on Wednesday 16<sup>th</sup> June 2021. Newly Promoted Watford and Norwich City plus either Swansea City or Brentford will be facing all the teams alongside the usual culprits, with the dates for the highly-anticipated London derbies confirmed too.</p>



<p><strong>Which Teams Will Participate For The 2021/2022 Season?</strong></p>



<p>The upcoming 2021/2022 Premier League season will feature 20 teams, with three newly promoted teams replacing the relegated teams (West Brom, Fulham, and Sheffield). Watford and Norwich have already booked a spot in the campaign after securing automatic qualification from the Championship. The two will be joined by the team that wins the Championship playoffs, with competing teams including Burnley, Swansea City, and Bournemouth.</p>



<p>The three relegated EPL teams won’t compete in the upcoming 2021/2022 season and will be playing against other Championship teams. However, Newcastle United, Burnley, and Sheffield United will have another shot at the EPL campaign after managing to avoid the drop.</p>



<p><strong>When Will The Summer Transfer Window Start And End?</strong></p>



<p>The English Premier League organizers have announced that the next summer transfer window will remain open till the end of August. According to a recent statement on the upcoming season, the summer transfer window is set to remain open for 12 weeks, starting from 9<sup>th</sup> June and close on 31<sup>st</sup> August at 23:00 BST. That will align with other leagues in Europe, offering plenty of opportunities to wager while watching the games live in stadiums and from broadcasts.</p>

<p>Do you bet online on sport? What sports do you bet on the most?</p>



<p>Any passionate bettor should know that betting has had quite the evolution, going from roadside kiosks handled by one bookmaker with his really big book, to an integrated website where you can bet on a variety of sports complete with really cool features like customer support, betting tips, better security, strategies and easy access to betting sites via the use of your mobile phone, computer or laptop.</p>



<p>Betting has evolved, and Betensured wanted to know just how much people&#8217;s attitude towards it had changed as well, so we conducted a survey on the pulse of gambling to see how people in Nigeria bet.</p>



<p>During our online betting survey, we focused on areas such as:</p>



<ul><li>Which Gender Bets More</li><li>Which Age Range Bets The Most</li><li>Why Do People Bet?</li><li>Where People Place Their Bets</li><li>Favorite Football Market</li><li>Favourite Sports Market</li><li>Favourite League To Bet On</li><li>How Many Odds Bettors Bet On</li><li>How Many Betting Sites People Use</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h2>Online Betting in Nigeria: A Look at the Trends, Facts and Stats in 2021</h2>

<p></p>



<p>During our survey, we found that:</p>



<p><strong>1:  Men Bets More Than Women</strong></p>



<p>Our survey reveals that we have more men using online sites to bet more than women. In a similar survey we took in 2019, men still gambled more than women.</p>



<p>This may be due to the fact that men are usually more passionate about sports and are generally more likely to take risks betting on sports.</p>



<p><strong>2: Age Group</strong></p>



<p>From the survey, we noticed that the age group that bet the most, were between the ages of 25-31, making up 33.69% of the bettors.</p>



<p>This shows that online betting is more prominent amongst people in their early twenties and thirties.</p>



<p><strong>3: Why People Bet</strong></p>



<p>When we asked 749 of our bettors why they bet, 610 of them, 81.44% said that they bet for the purpose of making money. That was the largest number of responses we got for this question. In 2019, more people&nbsp; gambled for money.</p>



<p>Online betting is lucrative and some bettors who are really good at it, walk away with wins running into millions and it is a fast way to make money.</p>



<p><strong>4: Which Countries Bet the Most</strong></p>



<p>Our survey showed that out  of the 5 African countries that took the survey, Nigeria had the highest number of bettors. They were 423, 57.48% Nigerians out of 749 people from other African countries and America, who took the survey. Nigerians are passionate about sports, especially football and they have some of the best betting sites like Betensured which is always willing to reward that passion with the best odds, promos, betting strategies and every other thing they&#8217;ll need to make betting and cashing out easy for them </p>



<p><strong>5: Where Do People Bet</strong></p>



<p>Mobile phones are the most preferred medium of placing bets, 66.71% of our bettors agree. In 2019, when we asked our bettors the question &#8220;How Do You Gamble?&#8221; mobile phones were chosen as the least preferred method of betting.</p>



<p>Now, mobile phones are more convenient for placing bets because they&#8217;re easily accessible.</p>



<p><strong>6: The Favourite Betting Markets for Bettors in Nigeria</strong></p>



<p>The Favourite football market for bettors in Nigeria is a straight win, this is according to 35.51% people, 266 bettors, the largest number for this response.</p>



<p><strong>7: Favourite Leaque People Bet On</strong></p>



<p>487 of our bettors, 66.02% say that English Premier League is their favourite league to bet on.</p>



<p>If you are interested, you can check out some <a href="https://www.betensured.com/predictions/football/England-Premier-League">football predictions for our English Premier League.</a></p>



<p><strong>8: Number of Betting Sites People Use</strong></p>



<p>242 of our bettors, 34.33% use two betting websites for betting on sports, this is the highest number for this question. In 2019, when we asked our bettors a similar question: How Many Bookmakers Do You Use? 37.3% of gamblers said they use one bookmaker, that was the highest number of responses at that time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>2019 VS 2021</strong>: <strong>State Of Online Betting In Nigeria</strong></h2>



<p>On comparing the two surveys &#8211; (go here to check out the <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-survey-2019-understand-the-betting-industry/">first survey in 2019</a>), we took on online betting and generally people&#8217;s behavior towards it, we discovered that not much has changed in the past 2 years as we found some similarities in how people bet now and how they bet then.</p>



<p>Similarities in bettors behaviours we found include:</p>



<ul><li>Men bet more than women in 2019 and again in 2021.</li><li>Nigeria still bets more than Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana. We had the highest number of online bettors in both 2019 and 2021.</li><li>The reason with the most response as to why people bet, was for the money. More people bet for money in 2019, and that pattern was repeated in 2021.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<ul><li>97.20% men gamble more than women and only 2.67% women bet.</li><li>70.5% of bettors use one or more than one betting sites.</li><li>81.44% bettors admitted to betting for the purpose of making money.</li><li>33.69% of people between 25-31 years bet more than other age grades.</li><li>Nigeria bets more than other African countries.</li><li>66.7% Bettors agree that mobile phones are the most preferred medium of betting.</li><li>35.51% people agree that a straight win is their favourite football market.</li><li>Our bettors favourite sports market is football, 97.2% agree.</li><li>Favourite league to bet on is European Premier League.</li><li>34.22% of bettors say that the bet on 2 sites.</li></ul>



<p>Online betting has evolved into something better and more convenient than how people used to bet in the past, but while some bettors&#8217; behaviour changed over the years; like going from betting on a road side kiosk to betting with your devices, somethings about betting hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>



<p>From two years ago till now, people continue going into online betting for money as they did two years ago, men are still betting more than women, and Nigeria bets more than other African countries, placed in the same class of countries that are passionate about sports as it is.</p>



<p>We think <a href="https://www.betensured.com/blog/football-betting-for-beginners-how-to-bet-on-football/">online betting</a> has come to stay, and the more it grows, the more bettors will find new ways to adapt to these upgrades made to it.</p>

<p>The away goals rule in all European club competitions has been abolished, UEFA has confirmed.</p>



<p>After being introduced in 1965, the rule of away goals will no longer be used from the 2021/22 season.</p>



<p>If ties end in a draw, they will be decided by extra time and penalties if required at the end of the 120 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>What have UEFA said?</strong></p>



<p>A statement on Thursday afternoon read: &#8220;Following the recommendation of the UEFA Club Competitions Committee and the UEFA Women&#8217;s Football Committee, the UEFA Executive Committee has today approved a proposal to remove the so-called away goals rule from all UEFA club competitions (men, women, and youth) as of the qualifying phases of the 2021/22 competitions.</p>



<p>&#8220;The away goals rule was applied to determine the winner of a two-legged knockout tie in cases where the two teams had scored the same number of goals on aggregate over the two matches. In such cases, the team which had scored the higher number of goals away from home was considered the winner of the tie and qualified for the next round of the competition. If the two teams had scored the same number of goals at home and away at the end of normal playing time in the second leg, extra time was played, followed by kicks from the penalty mark if no goal was scored.</p>



<p>With the decision to remove this rule, ties in which the two teams score the same number of goals over the two legs would be not decided on the number of goals scored away, but two 15-minute periods of extra time are played at the end of the second leg and in case the teams score the same number of goals or no goals during this extra time, kicks from the penalty mark would determine the team which qualifies to the next stage of the competition.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since away goals would no longer be given additional weight to decide a tie, they would also be removed from the criteria used to determine the rankings when two or more teams are equal on points in the group stage, i.e., the criteria applied to matches played by the teams in question. They would not be removed from the additional criteria applied to all group matches if the teams remain equal (higher number of away goals scored in all group matches) to retain a maximum number of sporting criteria.</p>



<p>&#8220;Statistics from the mid-1970s until now show a clear trend of continuous reduction in the gap between the number of home/away wins (from 61%/19% to 47%/30%) and the average number of goals per match scored at home/away (from 2.02/0.95 to 1.58/1.15) in men&#8217;s competitions, whereas since 2009/10, the average goals per game have remained remarkably steady in the UEFA Women&#8217;s Champions League with the overall average of 1.92 for home teams and 1.6 for away teams.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many different factors may be considered as having an impact on this decline in home advantage. Better pitch quality and standardized pitch sizes, improved stadium infrastructure, higher security conditions, enhanced care of refereeing (and more recently, the introduction of technological support such as GLT and VAR), wider and more sophisticated TV coverage of matches, more comfortable travel conditions, a compressed calendar dictating squad turnover, and changes in competition formats are all elements which have affected the way football is played and blurred the lines between playing at home and away.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What has the UEFA President said?</strong></p>



<p>Aleksander Čeferin added: &#8220;The away goals rule has been an intrinsic part of UEFA competitions since it was introduced in 1965. However, its abolition has been debated at various UEFA meetings over the last few years. Although there was no unanimity of views, many coaches, fans, and other football stakeholders have questioned its fairness and have expressed a preference for the rule to be abolished.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The impact of the rule now runs counter to its original purpose as, in fact, it now dissuades home teams – especially in first legs – from attacking because they fear conceding a goal that would give their opponents a crucial advantage. There is also criticism of the unfairness, especially in extra time, of obliging the home team to score twice when the away team has scored.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is fair to say that home advantage is nowadays no longer as significant as it once was, &#8220;the UEFA President concluded. &#8220;Taking into consideration the consistency across Europe in terms of styles of play, and many different factors which have led to a decline in home advantage, the UEFA Executive Committee has taken the correct decision in adopting the view that it is no longer appropriate for an away goal to carry more weight than one scored at home.&#8221;</p>



<p>While the decision has brought about split opinions amongst fans and pundits, it is no surprise seeing a group of people to think the decision is purely political as UEFA has always centered around certain unpalatable decisions to football and killing the excitement the away goal rule brings, especially in the UEFA champions league.</p>



<p><strong>Five famous Champions League away goals win in recent years</strong></p>



<p>May 2019: Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (3-3 on aggregate &#8211; Tottenham win on away goals)<br>Tottenham reached their first Champions League final in the most dramatic of circumstances in May 2019. Trailing Ajax 1-0 from the first leg, Mauricio Pochettino&#8217;s side trailed 2-0 at half-time of the return game in Amsterdam and looked all certain to be knocked out.</p>



<p>Step forward Lucas Moura, who scored two goals in four second-half minutes to bring Spurs level on the night, before firing home a 96th-minute winner to complete his hat-trick and send them through to the final.</p>



<p>April 2019: Man City 4-3 Tottenham (4-4 on aggregate &#8211; Tottenham win on away goals)<br>With Tottenham protecting a 1-0 lead from their quarter-final first leg against Manchester City, the two sides shared five goals inside a chaotic opening 21 minutes of the second leg. Sergio Aguero made it 4-2 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate in the second half to put Pep Guardiola&#8217;s side on course for the last four, before Fernando Llorente&#8217;s header edged Spurs ahead on away goals.</p>



<p>To add to the drama, Raheem Sterling saw his stoppage-time strike ruled out by VAR, leaving Guardiola on his knees in despair.</p>



<p>March 2019: Paris Saint-Germain 1-3 Man Utd (3-3 on aggregate &#8211; Man Utd win on away goals)<br>Manchester United became the first team in Champions League/European Cup history to overcome a 2-0 or greater home first-leg deficit when they stunned Paris Saint-Germain in March 2019.</p>



<p>Marcus Rashford was the hero with a nerveless 94th-minute penalty to level the tie at 3-3 on aggregate and send the Red Devils through on away goals, arguably securing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the manager&#8217;s job on a permanent basis in the process.</p>



<p>April 2018: Roma 3-0 Barcelona (Aggregate 4-4 &#8211; Roma win on away goals)<br>Another thrilling second-leg comeback, this time from Roma, as they overturned a 4-1 first-leg deficit to progress past Barcelona and go through to the semi-finals.</p>



<p>Defender Kostas Manolas scored the crucial third goal, heading in at the near post with eight minutes remaining to spark scenes of delirium inside the Stadio Olimpico.</p>



<p>May 2009: Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (1-1 on aggregate &#8211; Barcelona win on away goals)<br>A stoppage-time strike from Andres Iniesta canceled out Michael Essien&#8217;s early goal and edged Barcelona past Chelsea and through to the final on away goals back in 2009, sparking scenes of chaos inside Stamford Bridge at full time.</p>



<p>It was all too much for a furious Didier Drogba who, frustrated from numerous refereeing decisions, launched a verbal tirade to referee Tom Ovrebo after the final whistle before swearing directly down a TV camera as he made his way off the pitch.</p>



<p>In conclusion, as much as UEFA might be right about home teams taking advantage of the away goal rule, I think the flare, despair, joy, energy, and goosebumps developed because of the away goal rule is the reason why the majority of the fans love the beautiful game of football. The scraping of the away goal rule now, I think, brings a balance to the game without any advantage for either the home or away team.</p>

<p><strong>EDITORIAL</strong></p>



<p><strong>kaka@betensured.com</strong></p>



<p>Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder will meet again in a trilogy fight on July 24 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The heavyweights have fought twice previously, with some fans believing there is no need for a third contest between the pair.</p>



<p>In their first bout at the end of 2018, Wilder floored Fury twice but was comprehensively outboxed for the majority of the bout.</p>



<p>Most believed the Brit had done enough to earn a decision victory, only for the judges to score it a controversial draw.</p>



<p>Fury opted to go in a different direction in 2019 and so the pair did not meet again until February 2020. This time around an aggressive ‘Gypsy King’ took the fight to the ‘Bronze Bomber’, flooring him twice and winning by stoppage in round seven. </p>



<p>In the aftermath, Wilder activated his contractual clause to force an immediate third fight, but the pandemic interrupted those plans.</p>



<p>As they approached the end of 2020, Fury’s camp announced that they believed the contract had now expired and so they were moving on to target an undisputed showdown Anthony Joshua instead.</p>



<p>Wilder activated the dispute resolution provision within their contract, taking the matter to arbitration where a retired judge presided over the issue.</p>



<p>He also came out and accused Fury of cheating in their rematch. Just as AJ vs Fury was fully agreed for August 14 in Saudi Arabia, the arbitrator ruled that Fury owed Wilder a third fight.</p>



<p>With the trilogy now official for July 24, Fury said: “I’m excited to once again be fighting in Las Vegas, the home of the ‘Gypsy King.&#8217;”</p>



<p>Fury is slated to fight Wilder for the third time on Saturday, July 24.</p>



<p>It will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. No news on fan attendance has been made yet.</p>



<p>As this will be a pay-per-view event in Vegas, UK fans can expect it to start no earlier than 4am on Sunday morning.</p>



<p>The WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles will be on the line and the winner could then take on Anthony Joshua in a huge unification bout later in the year.</p>



<p>“For the last 18 months, I’ve been living rent free in Wilder’s head.</p>



<p>“He got smashed to pieces in our last fight, and for some reason, he wants it again.</p>



<p>“Let’s go. The big dosser is getting knocked spark out.”</p>



<p>Wilder said: “Nothing has changed. It’s still one face, one name, one champion – Deontay Wilder.</p>



<p>“I’m in the best shape of my life. July 24, I’m going to show the people why I’m still the baddest man on the planet.</p>



<p><strong>Fury vs Wilder 3: What has been said?</strong></p>



<p>Tyson Fury: “You’re getting smashed. When I say smashed, I mean smash, smash, smash, bang.</p>



<p>“You’re getting knocked out. End of. One round, you’re going. I’ve got your soul, your mojo, everything.</p>



<p>“I’m excited to once again be fighting in Las Vegas, the home of the ‘Gypsy King.’</p>



<p>“For the last 18 months, I’ve been living rent free in Wilder’s head.</p>



<p>“He got smashed to pieces in our last fight, and for some reason, he wants it again.</p>



<p>“Let’s go. The big dosser is getting knocked spark out.”</p>



<p>Deontay Wilder: “Nothing has changed. It’s still one face, one name, one champion – Deontay Wilder.</p>



<p>“I’m in the best shape of my life. July 24, I’m going to show the people why I’m still the baddest man on the planet.</p>



<p>“Y’all don’t wanna miss this one. My mindset is just so different right now. Even right now, I don’t even feel like I’m here.</p>



<p>“My mentality is – you’ve been contemplating about hurting a person so bad, to the point you wanna disfigure him so his mother wouldn’t even know who he was.</p>



<p>“When you’ve had your mind on that, like you wanna decapitate him in every f****** way possible, it’s like that premeditated stuff.</p>



<p>“When I do see him, I’m gonna love to see what I feel and what I’m thinking, how my senses change when he’s in my environment. I’ve been contemplating, premeditating whooping this man.</p>



<p>“Now that we have a date, like training has been even more intense.</p>



<p>“Those other camps, although they were intense, we had no guidance, no ETA, we just knew we wanted to stay in shape… Now it means something now. It’s for certain now.</p>



<p>“There’s nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you got to go through me. The hardest puncher in the heavyweight division, probably in history, and I’m going to continue to do that.”</p>

<p>EDITORIAL</p>



<p>kaka@betensured.com</p>



<p>After a year-long delay, one of the biggest and most exciting sporting events will kick off this week in major cities across Europe.</p>



<p>The 2020 UEFA European Championship, colloquially known as Euro 2020, was originally slated to take place last summer, but the global pandemic forced the postponement of the quadrennial competition.</p>



<p>Now, the second biggest international tournament – second only to the FIFA World Cup – is back on track with 24 European national teams ready to do battle over the next month.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>



<p><strong>How does the Euro 2020 tournament work?</strong></p>



<p>The 24-nation field has been divided into six round-robin groups, and the first round runs from June 11 to June 23.</p>



<p>The top two teams in each group, plus the four-best third-place teams overall, advance to the round of 16 which begins on June 26. From there, it’s a single elimination format right up until the final on July 11.</p>



<p><strong>The six groups are:</strong></p>



<p>Group A: Italy, Switzerland, Turkey and Wales<br>Group B: Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Russia<br>Group C: Austria, Netherlands, North Macedonia and Ukraine<br>Group D: Croatia, Czech Republic, England and Scotland<br>Group E: Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and Spain<br>Group F: France, Germany, Hungary and Portugal</p>



<p><strong>Who’s hosting the tournament?</strong></p>



<p>Unlike past European Championships that had one or two nations act as hosts, Euro 2020 is a pan-European event, with matches taking place in 11 cities in 11 countries.</p>



<p>A pair of cities will stage games in each of the first-round groups, giving some nations home-field advantage. The host cities for the group stage are: Rome and Baku (Group A), Saint Petersburg and Copenhagen (Group B), Amsterdam and Bucharest (Group C), London and Glasgow (Group D), Seville and Saint Petersburg (Group E) and Munich and Budapest (Group E).</p>



<p>Round of 16 matches will be split between Amsterdam, Bucharest, Budapest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, London (two matches) and Seville. The quarterfinals will take place in Baku, Munich, Rome and Saint Petersburg. London’s Wembley Stadium will stage both semifinals and the final.</p>



<p><strong>Will fans be allowed to attend matches?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Each of the 11 host cities will have fans inside their stadiums for the matches this summer.</p>



<p>Ten cities are shooting for anywhere from 22 to 50 per cent of stadium capacity, while Budapest is aiming to have 100 per cent capacity (with strict stadium entry requirements in place).</p>



<p>Those numbers might change over time, but either way, teams will be playing in front of fans at Euro 2020.</p>



<p>It’s still being called Euro 2020 even though we’re in 2021?</p>



<p>Last April, the Executive Committee of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, ruled that the tournament will still retain the name “UEFA Euro 2020.”</p>



<p>In making its decision, UEFA stated this will “serve to remember how the whole football family came together to respond to the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficult times Europe, and the world, had to go through in 2020.”</p>



<p><strong>Who are some of the favourites at Euro 2020?</strong></p>



<p>Reigning World Cup champions France enter Euro 2020 as the top favourite. Coach Didier Deschamps has a number of quality options at every position and Les Bleus have such great depth that they could field two teams at this tournament.</p>



<p>After a semifinal showing at the 2018 World Cup, England could go one better and win its first European championship this summer. Manager Gareth Southgate has a crop of attacking players that is the envy of most other teams at Euro 2020. England’s dangerous front line features Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford, and the Three Lions have players the calibre of Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, and Jack Grealish waiting in the wings.</p>



<p>Other nations to watch out for include Belgium (No. 1 in the current FIFA rankings), defending European champions Portugal, Germany (like France, they have great depth and quality) and an Italian team that is playing some dynamic soccer under manager Roberto Mancini.</p>



<p><strong>Who could be a dark horse?</strong></p>



<p>Don’t overlook Turkey, who conceded just three goals and finished tied with Belgium for the best defensive record during the qualifiers. They posted an impressive eight clean sheets in 10 games, including a home win over France. Şenol Güneş is an experienced manager who led Turkey to a third-place finish at the 2002 World Cup. Could he pull off another surprise this summer?</p>



<p><strong>Any newcomers at Euro 2020?</strong></p>



<p>Finland is appearing in its first ever major international competition – the Nordic country has never previously qualified for a World Cup or a European championship. Veteran forward Teemu Pukki scored 10 goals in the qualifiers for the Finns, who beat out Greece for second place in Group J and a tournament berth.</p>



<p>Another debutant is North Macedonia, who qualified for Euro 2020 via the playoffs, beating Kosovo and Georgia to book its place at a major international tournament for the first time in the nation’s history.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a Group of Death?</strong></p>



<p>Most of the six groups are evenly balanced and should be competitive. But Group F has to be considered the toughest group, as it features France, Germany and Portugal – these teams have combined to win the last two World Cups and Euro 2016 – and Hungary, a nation that is enjoying a bit of a renaissance.</p>



<p>With all of the group games taking place in Munich and Budapest, Germany and Hungary have a big advantage, but you’d be foolish to write off France – they are the defending World Cup champions, after all – and a Portugal side featuring Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>



<p><strong>Who are some of the top players to watch?</strong><br>France’s Kylian Mbappé was a teenager when he took the 2018 World Cup by storm, scoring four goals en route to winning the tournament’s best young player award. Now 22, the Paris Saint-Germain forward is primed to lead Les Bleus to its third European title.</p>



<p>Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo always seems to deliver for his country on the international stage. Germany’s Serge Gnabry bagged an impressive eight goals in just seven appearances during the qualifiers. Poland’s Robert Lewandowski is one of the most in-form forwards in world soccer at the moment, while fellow goal-scorers Romelu Lukaku of Belgium and England’s Harry Kane are coming off strong domestic campaigns for their clubs, Inter Milan and Tottenham.</p>



<p><strong>Who could be a major breakout player?</strong></p>



<p>There are too many to choose from, but two players you might want to keep close tabs on are England’s Phil Foden and Italy’s Manuel Locatelli.</p>



<p>Only 21, Foden was a key starter for a Manchester City team that won the Premier League and reached the UEFA Champions League finals this season. Foden only has six caps and hasn’t played in a major international tournament, but he’s one of the best young attacking midfielders in the world right now.</p>



<p>Locatelli, 23, is a midfielder who flies under the radar because he plays for a modest side in Sassuolo rather than one of Serie A’s giant clubs such as Juventus or Inter Milan. But he’s drawn comparison to a former great Italian midfield maestro in Andrea Pirlo, as he is elegant in possession and a sublime deep-lying playmaker.</p>



<p><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong><br>There are a few rules changes in place for Euro 2020, some with which you’re probably already familiar.</p>



<p>Teams are allowed a maximum of five substitutions in matches, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, coaches only have three windows in a game to make substitutions (with a fourth window in extra time), not including substitutions made at half-time, at the start of and during half-time of extra time.</p>



<p>Roster sizes have increased to 26 players, up from the usual 23. But, teams can only name a maximum of 23 players to their gameday squads.</p>



<p>Also, UEFA announced last week that an adjustment to the handball rule will be in effect for Euro 2020. According to a rule change approved earlier this year by the International Football Association Board (world soccer’s law-making body), an accidental handball by an attacking player in the build-up to a goal will longer be penalized.</p>



<p>“The way the law has been rewritten is more according to the spirit of football and gives players the freedom to play football,” said Roberto Rosetti, UEFA’s chief refereeing officer.</p>
